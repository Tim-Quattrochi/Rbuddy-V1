# **1. Introduction**

This document outlines a two-phase architectural approach. The **primary goal (Phase 1)** is to design the **corrective architecture** to fix the data persistence failure in the "Daily Ritual" feature. The **secondary goal (Phase 2)** is to detail the **enhancement architecture** for integrating new features (Authentication, Rupture & Repair, Journaling) onto that stable foundation.

## **Existing Project Analysis**

* **Current Project State**: The application is a PWA built with React 18 and an Express.js backend. Its core feature, the "Daily Ritual" flow, is currently non-functional due to a lack of end-to-end data persistence.
* **Identified Constraints**: The most critical constraint is the non-functional state of the core feature. This architecture **must prioritize the fix** before detailing new functionality.
