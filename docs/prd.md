## 1. Vision

### 1.1 Purpose
Reentry Buddy (institutional alias *Reentry Companion*) is a digital recovery support system designed for justice-impacted individuals reentering society after incarceration.  
Its mission is to provide structure, consistency, and emotional regulation through a daily ritual flow accessible on any mobile device ‚Äî including basic phones.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Justice-impacted individuals with substance use challenges often struggle with a lack of structure, high stress, and digital barriers (limited data, lost devices, low literacy).  
Existing recovery apps assume smartphone access, leaving a gap for low-access users who still need daily grounding and positive feedback.

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Reentry Buddy bridges that gap through **Tier 1 accessibility** ‚Äî a low-data SMS and IVR (voice) solution that enables:
- A short **Daily Ritual Flow (2‚Äì5 minutes)** via text or call.  
- A **Rupture and Repair** process for relapse moments (‚ÄúSLIP‚Äù).  
- Positive reinforcement that emphasizes progress, not failure.  

### 1.4 Target Users
- **Primary Actor:** Returning citizens (justice-impacted individuals) in early-stage recovery.
- **Context:** Limited digital literacy, low trust in technology, may rely on prepaid phones.
- **Accessibility Goal:** Plain-language content written at or below a 6th-grade reading level.

## 2. Scope and Requirements

### 2.1 In Scope (10-Day MVP - Phase 1: PWA)
| Feature | Description | Priority | Status |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **F1 ‚Äì Daily Ritual Flow (PWA)** | 2‚Äì5 min check-in via **Progressive Web App** capturing mood ‚Üí affirmation ‚Üí optional intention. | P0 | ‚úÖ In Scope |
| **F2 ‚Äì Rupture & Repair Flow** | "I slipped" button triggers compassionate relapse reset with repair suggestions. | P0 | ‚úÖ In Scope |
| **F3 ‚Äì Encouragement Loop** | **Web push notifications** for inactivity or streak milestones. | P1 | ‚úÖ In Scope |
| **F4 ‚Äì User State Logging** | Anonymous session storage for mood, triggers, and streaks. | P1 | ‚úÖ In Scope |
| **F7 ‚Äì User Dashboard** | Visual progress tracking with streak display, mood trends, and calendar. | P0 | ‚úÖ Enhanced |
| **F8 ‚Äì Offline Support** | Service worker enables offline check-ins with background sync when connection restored. | P1 | ‚úÖ New |

### 2.2 Deferred to Phase 2 (Post-MVP)
| Feature | Description | Original Priority | Deferral Reason |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **F1b ‚Äì SMS/IVR (Voice)** | SMS text or voice call version of Daily Ritual Flow. | P0 ‚Üí P2 | PWA provides better UX; SMS as fallback notification only. |
| **F5 ‚Äì Coach Summary** | Weekly aggregate summaries for partner coaches. | P2 | No change - remains Phase 2. |
| **F6 ‚Äì Language & Accessibility Layer** | English-first; bilingual (EN/ES) expansion framework. | P2 | No change - remains Phase 2. |

**Scope Rationale**: 10-day timeline prioritizes PWA development leveraging smartphone accessibility via Lifeline program. PWA provides richer UX (visual feedback, offline support, push notifications) at lower operational cost ($0 messaging vs. $0.0079/SMS). All P0 recovery support features (Daily Ritual, Repair, Encouragement) remain in scope with enhanced capabilities.

**Accessibility Update**: Target users now assumed to have Lifeline-provided smartphones or access via reentry org device lending programs. PWA approach maintains low-friction access (no app store required, works offline) while enabling visual progress tracking and richer engagement features.

### 2.3 Out of Scope (All Phases)
- Native mobile app (App Store/Google Play).
- AI chatbot or adaptive recommendation engine.
- Clinical data integration (EHR).
- Long-form journaling or audio storage beyond short intention text.
- Case-management dashboard (beyond aggregate metrics view).

### 2.4 Primary Actor: Returning Citizen in Recovery
A justice-impacted individual within 12 months of release, working through substance use recovery using a **Lifeline-provided smartphone or borrowed device**.
They need simple, supportive routines without judgment or technical friction. PWA provides app-like experience without app store barriers, works offline after first load, and enables visual progress tracking.

## 4. Technical Requirements and Architecture Overview

### 4.1 Core Architecture (10-Day PWA MVP Implementation)
- **Interface:** Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline-first architecture via Service Workers.
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui component library + React Router v7.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript (Vercel serverless functions).
- **Data Store:** PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM.
- **Notifications:** Web Push API with VAPID (no Twilio dependency).
- **Offline:** Service Worker + IndexedDB for local caching and background sync.
- **Monitoring:** Vercel logs + Sentry for error tracking.
- **Security:** TLS, JWT session tokens, Neon PostgreSQL encryption at rest, CSP headers.

**Tech Stack Rationale**: Leverages existing TypeScript/Express/PostgreSQL/React codebase for rapid 10-day MVP delivery. Brownfield enhancement approach converts SMS webhook handlers to REST API endpoints and extends existing React UI (investor dashboard) to full user-facing PWA. PWA eliminates $75+/month Twilio SMS costs while enabling richer visual UX and offline support.

### 4.2 Conversation Engine (Refactored for PWA)
- Finite-state machine (FSM) controlling "Daily Ritual" and "Repair" flows (reused from SMS implementation).
- REST API endpoints return JSON responses instead of TwiML strings.
- Each step logs to DB with `session_id` for continuity across offline/online transitions.
- JSON-based flow definitions for non-dev content updates.

### 4.3 REST API Endpoints
- `POST /api/daily-ritual/start` ‚Üí Returns session ID and mood prompt
- `POST /api/daily-ritual/mood` ‚Üí Returns affirmation based on mood selection
- `POST /api/daily-ritual/intention` ‚Üí Logs intention and completes session
- `POST /api/repair/start` ‚Üí Initiates repair flow
- `POST /api/repair/trigger` ‚Üí Logs trigger and returns repair message
- `GET /api/user/stats` ‚Üí Returns streak count and mood trends
- `POST /api/auth/request-code` ‚Üí Sends SMS verification code (minimal Twilio use)
- `POST /api/auth/verify-code` ‚Üí Validates code and returns JWT
- `POST /api/notifications/subscribe` ‚Üí Registers push notification subscription

### 4.4 Data Model (Updated for PWA)
- **Users** ‚Üí `user_id`, `phone_hash`, `preferred_time`, `language`, `device_token` (push notifications), `last_sync_at`, `enable_push_notifications`
- **Sessions** ‚Üí `session_id`, `user_id`, `flow_type`, `mood`, `intention`, `timestamp`, `channel` ('pwa'/'sms')
- **Interactions** (renamed from Messages) ‚Üí `id`, `user_id`, `session_id`, `direction`, `channel`, `content_type`, `body`, `created_at`
- **FollowUps** ‚Üí `id`, `user_id`, `message_type`, `channel`, `scheduled_at`, `status`, `push_payload`

### 4.5 PWA-Specific Requirements
- **Service Worker:** Cache-first strategy for app shell, network-first for API calls with fallback to IndexedDB
- **Manifest:** Icons (192px, 512px), splash screen, standalone display mode, theme colors
- **Web Push:** VAPID key pair for push notifications, subscription management
- **Offline Storage:** IndexedDB stores pending interactions for background sync
- **Background Sync:** Queues failed API calls, retries when connection restored

### 4.6 Security & Privacy
- Anonymous IDs only; no direct PII stored beyond hashed phone number.
- JWT tokens for session management (7-day expiry).
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS.
- HTTPS-only (enforced by Vercel).
- 90-day retention; data auto-purged post-pilot.
