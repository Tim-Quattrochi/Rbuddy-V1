# Logo Rendering Issue in Vercel Production - Diagnosis & Fix

## Problem
`logo-4.png` was not rendering in Vercel production environment, despite working locally.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Investigation (5-7 Potential Sources)
1. ❌ Incorrect `publicDir` configuration in vite.config.ts
2. ❌ Missing from VitePWA `includeAssets` array
3. ✅ Build output directory mismatch
4. ✅ Vercel static file serving configuration
5. ⚠️ Case sensitivity (not the issue, but worth monitoring)
6. ⚠️ Missing file in build output (consequence of root cause)
7. ⚠️ Incorrect root directory configuration (related to root cause)

### Confirmed Root Causes (2 Most Likely)

#### 1. **Incorrect `publicDir` Configuration** ✓ FIXED
**Location:** `vite.config.ts:114`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client"),
publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "public"),  // ❌ Wrong path
```

The `publicDir` was pointing to `/Users/timquattrochi/Projects/rBuddy-v1/public` (which doesn't exist), instead of `/Users/timquattrochi/Projects/rBuddy-v1/client/public` (where assets actually are).

**Solution:**
```typescript
// AFTER (Correct)
root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client"),
publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "client/public"),  // ✓ Correct path
```

#### 2. **Missing from VitePWA `includeAssets`** ✓ FIXED
**Location:** `vite.config.ts:14-20`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Incomplete)
includeAssets: [
  "favicon.ico",
  "icon.svg",
  "apple-touch-icon-180x180.png",
  "pwa-*.png",
  "maskable-icon-*.png",
  // ❌ logo-4.png and other logos not included
],
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// AFTER (Complete)
includeAssets: [
  "favicon.ico",
  "icon.svg",
  "apple-touch-icon-180x180.png",
  "pwa-*.png",
  "maskable-icon-*.png",
  "logo-*.png",        // ✓ Added
  "nm-logo*.png",      // ✓ Added
],
```

## Verification

### Build Test Results
```bash
$ npm run build
✓ built in 1.50s
PWA v0.21.2
precache  16 entries (498.99 KiB)
```

### Asset Copy Verification
```bash
$ ls -la dist/*.png | grep -E "(logo|nm-logo)"
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  583755 Oct 14 21:18 dist/logo-2.png
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff    8619 Oct 14 21:18 dist/logo-4.png      ✓
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  263550 Oct 14 21:18 dist/nm-logo-alt.png ✓
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   37868 Oct 14 21:18 dist/nm-logo.png     ✓
```

## Impact
- **Before:** Logo files were not copied to the `dist/` folder during build, causing 404 errors in production
- **After:** All logo files are now properly included in the build output and will be served correctly by Vercel

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to version control
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Verify logo renders correctly in production
4. Monitor for any other static asset issues

## Related Files Modified
- [`vite.config.ts`](../vite.config.ts) - Fixed `publicDir` path and added logo patterns to `includeAssets`

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always verify `publicDir` matches the actual location of public assets relative to project root
2. Include all custom asset patterns in VitePWA's `includeAssets` array
3. Test builds locally and verify assets are copied to `dist/` before deploying
4. Use `ls -la dist/` to verify all expected assets are present after build
