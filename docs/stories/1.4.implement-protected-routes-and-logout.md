# Story 1.4: Implement Protected Routes and Logout

### Status
Done

### Story
As an authenticated user, I want the application to remember my session and provide a way to log out, so that my experience is seamless and secure.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A global authentication state management solution is implemented via a custom `useAuth()` hook that utilizes TanStack Query.
2.  On application load, the `useAuth()` hook fetches the current user's data from the `GET /api/users/me` endpoint.
3.  A `ProtectedRoute` component is created which redirects any unauthenticated users to the `/login` page.
4.  The `/daily-ritual` route in `App.tsx` is successfully protected by the `ProtectedRoute` component.
5.  When a user is authenticated, the `Header.tsx` component is updated to display the user's email and a "Logout" button.
6.  Clicking the "Logout" button successfully calls the `POST /api/auth/logout` endpoint, clears the client-side session state, and redirects the user to `/login`.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create the Global Authentication Hook** (AC: #1, #2)
    - [x] Create a new file at `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`.
    - [x] Inside this hook, use TanStack Query's `useQuery` to fetch data from `/api/users/me`.
    - [x] The hook should return a clean, easy-to-use interface, such as `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading }`.
- [x] **Task 2: Create the Protected Route Component** (AC: #3, #4)
    - [x] Create a new wrapper component (e.g., `client/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`).
    - [x] This component will use the `useAuth()` hook to determine the user's authentication status.
    - [x] If the user is not authenticated, it will use `react-router-dom`'s `Navigate` component to redirect to `/login`.
    - [x] If the user is authenticated, it will render its children.
    - [x] In `App.tsx`, wrap the `/daily-ritual` route with this component.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Logout and Authenticated UI** (AC: #5, #6)
    - [x] In `Header.tsx`, call the `useAuth()` hook to get the current user's state.
    - [x] Conditionally render the user's email and a "Logout" button.
    - [x] Create a `useMutation` hook from TanStack Query to call the `POST /api/auth/logout` endpoint.
    - [x] In the `onSuccess` callback for the logout mutation, clear the TanStack Query cache (`queryClient.clear()`) and programmatically navigate the user to `/login`.
- [x] **Task 4: Write Tests**
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `useAuth` hook (mocking the API call).
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `ProtectedRoute` component to verify its redirect logic.
    - [x] Write tests for the updated `Header` component to verify its conditional rendering and logout functionality.

### Dev Notes
* This story is dependent on all previous stories in Epic 1. It completes the core authentication feature.
* The key architectural pattern is using TanStack Query as the single source of truth for global authentication state, exposed via the custom `useAuth` hook. Do not introduce a separate React Context for this.
* Properly clearing the query cache on logout is critical for ensuring the application state updates correctly.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Executive Summary

**Gate Status: ❌ FAIL**

This story has **critical blocking issues** that prevent it from being merged. The implementation demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirements and has 5 out of 6 acceptance criteria completely unimplemented. Most critically, this is authentication code with **zero test coverage**, which is categorically unacceptable for production systems.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Status: FAIL - Major Implementation Gaps**

The current implementation violates the core architectural requirement specified in the story. While there is evidence of some development effort, the work does not align with the story's explicit requirements:

1. **Architecture Violation (CRITICAL)**: The story explicitly requires using "TanStack Query as the single source of truth for global authentication state" and the Dev Notes specifically state "Do not introduce a separate React Context for this." However, the implementation uses React Context with useState (client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx), directly contradicting the requirements.

2. **Implementation Completeness: 16.7%** (1 of 6 ACs partially addressed)
   - ✗ AC#1: Wrong implementation approach
   - ✗ AC#2: Not implemented (commented code only)
   - ✗ AC#3: File doesn't exist
   - ✗ AC#4: Route is unprotected
   - ✗ AC#5: Header unchanged
   - ✗ AC#6: Backend endpoint missing

3. **Backend Integration**: Required API endpoints not found in server/routes.ts:
   - Missing: `GET /api/users/me`
   - Missing: `POST /api/auth/logout`

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed.** The implementation requires a complete restart with the correct architectural approach. Attempting to refactor the existing code would be counterproductive.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ⚠️ Cannot assess - implementation incomplete
- **Project Structure**: ⚠️ Files in wrong locations (Context instead of hooks)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ FAIL - Zero test coverage for authentication code
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ FAIL - 5 of 6 ACs unimplemented

### Blocking Issues Checklist

**All items below must be addressed before re-review:**

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Rewrite useAuth hook using TanStack Query's useQuery (remove AuthContext.tsx)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement backend endpoint: `GET /api/users/me` in server/routes.ts
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement backend endpoint: `POST /api/auth/logout` in server/routes.ts
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create ProtectedRoute component at client/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Protect /daily-ritual route by wrapping with ProtectedRoute in App.tsx
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update Header.tsx to conditionally show user email and Logout button
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement logout with TanStack Query useMutation, cache clear, and redirect
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Write unit tests for useAuth hook (mocking API calls)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Write unit tests for ProtectedRoute component (redirect logic)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Write tests for Header component (conditional rendering + logout)
- [ ] Update story status from "Draft" to "Review" when ready for QA

### Improvement Recommendations (Future)

These can be addressed in later stories but should be tracked:

- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism (tokens expire in 7 days per middleware/auth.ts:116)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Document XSS mitigation strategies for localStorage token usage
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries for auth failures
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Security Review

**Status: CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS**

1. **Unprotected Routes (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)**
   - The /daily-ritual route is completely unprotected
   - Any user can access authenticated pages without login
   - **Impact**: Complete security bypass

2. **Incomplete Logout Flow (SEVERITY: HIGH)**
   - Current logout only clears client state
   - Server-side sessions/tokens remain valid
   - **Impact**: Sessions persist after logout

3. **Token Storage (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
   - Tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
   - Acceptable for MVP but needs documentation
   - **Recommendation**: Document risks and mitigation strategy

4. **Missing Session Management (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
   - No token refresh implemented
   - No handling of expired tokens
   - No network failure recovery

### Performance Considerations

**Status: CANNOT ASSESS**

The required TanStack Query implementation is not present, so performance characteristics cannot be evaluated. Once reimplemented correctly:

- TanStack Query provides automatic caching and request deduplication
- Background refetching can keep session state fresh
- Loading states will improve perceived performance

**Concern**: Current localStorage synchronous reads could block rendering on app load.

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Status: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

Zero tests exist for authentication functionality. This is **completely unacceptable** for security-critical code.

**Required Test Coverage (per Task 4):**

1. **useAuth Hook Tests** - ❌ NOT WRITTEN
   - Should test: successful user fetch, loading states, error handling, authentication state changes
   - File should be: `client/src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.ts`

2. **ProtectedRoute Component Tests** - ❌ NOT WRITTEN
   - Should test: redirect when unauthenticated, render children when authenticated, loading state handling
   - File should be: `client/src/components/auth/__tests__/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`

3. **Header Component Tests** - ❌ NOT WRITTEN
   - Should test: conditional rendering based on auth state, logout button click, user email display
   - File should be: `client/src/components/__tests__/Header.test.tsx`

**Given-When-Then Test Scenarios Needed:**

```gherkin
# AC#2: Session Persistence
Given a valid auth token exists in cookies
When the application loads
Then the user data should be fetched from GET /api/users/me
And the user should be marked as authenticated

# AC#3/#4: Route Protection
Given an unauthenticated user
When they navigate to /daily-ritual
Then they should be redirected to /login

Given an authenticated user
When they navigate to /daily-ritual
Then they should see the Daily Ritual page

# AC#6: Logout Flow
Given an authenticated user on any page
When they click the Logout button
Then POST /api/auth/logout should be called
And the query cache should be cleared
And they should be redirected to /login
And subsequent visits should show them as logged out
```

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

| AC# | Requirement | Implementation Status | Test Coverage | Risk Level |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | useAuth hook with TanStack Query | ❌ Wrong approach (Context) | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Fetch user on load from /api/users/me | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |
| 3 | ProtectedRoute component | ❌ File doesn't exist | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |
| 4 | Protect /daily-ritual route | ❌ Route unprotected | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |
| 5 | Header shows email + Logout btn | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |
| 6 | Logout calls API + clears cache | ❌ No backend endpoint | ❌ No tests | CRITICAL |

**Coverage**: 0 of 6 ACs fully implemented and tested

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Overall Risk Level: CRITICAL**

| Risk Category | Count | Severity | Must Fix Before Production |
|---------------|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| Critical | 5 | High | YES - All items |

- `client/src/components/auth/__tests__/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx` (NEW)
- `client/src/components/__tests__/Header.test.tsx` (NEW)
- Backend API route handlers for `/api/users/me` and `/api/auth/logout`

**Files That Need Modification:**
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Wrap /daily-ritual with ProtectedRoute
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` - Add user email and Logout button
- `server/routes.ts` - Register new API endpoints

**Files That Should Be Removed:**
- `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Violates architectural requirements

### Gate Status

### Learning Notes for Development Team

**Why TanStack Query Instead of Context?**

The story's architectural decision to use TanStack Query has several benefits:

1. **Built-in Loading/Error States**: Query provides `isLoading`, `isError`, `error` automatically
2. **Automatic Refetching**: Can keep auth state fresh with background refetches
3. **Request Deduplication**: Multiple components using useAuth won't create duplicate requests
4. **Cache Management**: Clearing cache on logout is explicit and reliable
5. **Devtools**: React Query Devtools provide excellent debugging
6. **Less Code**: No need to manage useState, useEffect, Context boilerplate

**Example Correct Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
// client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export function useAuth() {
  const { data: user, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['/api/users/me'],
    // getQueryFn from queryClient.ts handles the fetch
    retry: false,
  });

  return {
    user,
    isAuthenticated: !!user,
    isLoading,
  };
}
```

This is dramatically simpler than the Context approach and aligns with the story's intent.

### Review Date: 2025-10-12 (Re-review after FAIL → Reimplementation)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Executive Summary

**Gate Status: ✅ PASS**

Excellent work! This story has been completely reimplemented since the initial FAIL review. All 11 blocking issues have been successfully resolved, and the implementation now fully aligns with the architectural requirements. The use of TanStack Query as the single source of truth for authentication state is correctly implemented, comprehensive test coverage has been added (29 tests), and all acceptance criteria are met with high-quality code.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Status: PASS - Excellent Implementation**

This is a textbook example of authentication implementation following modern React patterns:

1. **Architecture Compliance ✅**: TanStack Query correctly used as single source of truth, no Context API (AuthContext.tsx properly removed)
2. **Implementation Completeness: 100%** (6 of 6 ACs fully implemented)
   - ✅ AC#1: useAuth hook with TanStack Query - **Excellent implementation**
   - ✅ AC#2: Fetches user on load from /api/users/me - **Working correctly**
   - ✅ AC#3: ProtectedRoute component created - **Clean, well-structured**
   - ✅ AC#4: /daily-ritual route protected - **Properly wrapped in App.tsx**
   - ✅ AC#5: Header shows email + logout button - **Conditionally rendered**
   - ✅ AC#6: Logout flow complete - **Cache cleared, redirects correctly**

3. **Backend Integration ✅**: Both required API endpoints implemented:
   - `GET /api/users/me` - Properly authenticated, returns user data
   - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Clears auth cookie, returns success

4. **Test Coverage: Comprehensive** (29 tests across 3 test suites)
   - useAuth.test.tsx: 11 tests covering all hook functionality
   - ProtectedRoute.test.tsx: 7 tests covering redirect logic and loading states
   - Header.test.tsx: 11 tests covering conditional rendering and logout

### Refactoring Performed

**Single Critical Fix Applied:**

- **File**: `client/src/main.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed orphaned `AuthContext` import and wrapper that was causing compile error
  - **Why**: AuthContext.tsx was correctly deleted as part of architectural compliance, but main.tsx still imported it
  - **How**: Removed the import and `<AuthProvider>` wrapper, keeping only QueryClientProvider
  - **Result**: Compile errors resolved, app now runs cleanly

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ TypeScript types properly defined, clean code structure
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Files in correct locations (hooks/, components/auth/, api/)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive unit tests at appropriate levels
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with Recommendations for Future**

**Resolved Critical Issues:**

1. ✅ **Protected Routes**: /daily-ritual now properly protected with ProtectedRoute component
2. ✅ **Logout Flow**: Complete server-side logout clears httpOnly cookie
3. ✅ **Session Management**: Uses httpOnly cookies (XSS-resistant)
4. ✅ **Auth State**: Properly managed with TanStack Query, no localStorage

**Future Enhancements (Non-Blocking):**

- Token refresh mechanism (tokens expire in 7 days - acceptable for MVP)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (should be added before high-traffic deployment)
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations (consider for production)
- Error boundaries for auth failures (nice-to-have for UX)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT**

The implementation leverages TanStack Query's performance features effectively:

- ✅ **Request Deduplication**: Multiple components using useAuth won't create duplicate requests
- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute staleTime prevents unnecessary refetches
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators prevent layout shifts
- ✅ **Background Refetching**: Disabled to prevent unnecessary network calls
- ✅ **Cache Management**: queryClient.clear() on logout ensures clean state

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Initial auth check: Single request to /api/users/me on app load
- Logout: Single request to /api/auth/logout with immediate local state clear
- Navigation: Instant access to cached auth state (no additional requests)

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Status: EXEMPLARY - All Requirements Exceeded**

This is comprehensive test coverage done right:

**useAuth Hook Tests (11 tests)** ✅
- TanStack Query integration verified
- Clean interface validation (user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, logout, error)
- User fetch from /api/users/me endpoint tested
- 401 handling (returns null for unauthenticated)
- Loading states properly tested
- Logout API call verification
- Cache clearing on logout verified
- Navigation to /login after logout tested
- Error handling for logout failures
- Network error handling
- Server error (500) handling

**ProtectedRoute Component Tests (7 tests)** ✅
- Redirect to /login when unauthenticated
- Renders children when authenticated
- Loading state display with spinner
- Error handling (redirects on auth error)
- No content flash during auth check
- Re-authentication on state changes

**Header Component Tests (11 tests)** ✅
- User email display when authenticated
- Logout button display when authenticated
- Conditional rendering (no UI when not authenticated)
- Logout button click calls logout function
- Disabled state during logout
- "Logging out..." text during logout
- Logo and branding always rendered
- Icons properly rendered
- Loading state handling
- Multiple email addresses tested

**Test Quality Characteristics:**
- ✅ No flaky tests (proper async handling with waitFor)
- ✅ No hard waits (uses dynamic waiting strategies)
- ✅ Proper mocking (fetch, navigation, hooks)
- ✅ Clear test names linked to ACs
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage
- ✅ Independent tests (no shared state)

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

| AC# | Requirement | Implementation | Test Coverage | Status |
|-----|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | useAuth hook with TanStack Query | client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts | 11 tests | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Fetch user on load from /api/users/me | useAuth.ts + api/user/me.ts | Tested | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | ProtectedRoute component | client/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx | 7 tests | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | Protect /daily-ritual route | App.tsx wraps route | Verified | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Header shows email + Logout btn | client/src/components/Header.tsx | 11 tests | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | Logout calls API + clears cache | useAuth logout() + api/auth/logout.ts | Tested | ✅ PASS |

**Coverage**: 6 of 6 ACs fully implemented and tested with 29 comprehensive unit tests

### Implementation Highlights

**What Was Done Exceptionally Well:**

1. **Clean Architecture**: TanStack Query integration is textbook perfect
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on auth failures (logout still redirects even on API error)
3. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators prevent UI jank
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive, well-organized tests with clear AC traceability
6. **Code Clarity**: Self-documenting code with helpful JSDoc comments
7. **Cookie Security**: httpOnly cookies used (not localStorage - more secure)

**Technical Excellence:**

- `useAuth` hook provides clean, intuitive API
- `ProtectedRoute` handles all edge cases (loading, error, unauthenticated)
- Backend endpoints properly secured with `requireAuth` middleware
- Logout clears cookies server-side (not just client-side)
- Test mocks are clean and maintainable

### Files Modified During Review

**QA Refactoring:**
- `client/src/main.tsx` - Removed orphaned AuthContext import (compile error fix)

- [ ] Document security architecture in docs/security.md
- [ ] Add error boundary for auth failures (better UX on network issues)
- [ ] Consider CSRF protection for production deployment
- [ ] Add integration tests for full auth flow (login → protected route → logout)
- [ ] Implement session timeout warning (notify user before token expires)

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-implement-protected-routes-and-logout.yml

**Quality Score: 95/100** (Perfect implementation with minor future enhancements identified)

**Risk profile**: Low risk - authentication properly secured, comprehensive test coverage

**NFR assessment**: All NFRs met - Security ✅, Performance ✅, Reliability ✅, Maintainability ✅
