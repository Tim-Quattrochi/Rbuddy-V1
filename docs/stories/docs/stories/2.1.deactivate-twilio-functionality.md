# Story 2.1: Safely Deactivate Twilio Endpoints and Dependencies

### Status
Draft

### Story
As a developer, I want to safely deactivate all Twilio-related API endpoints and dependencies, so they don't run or interfere with the PWA functionality, while preserving the underlying code for potential future use.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The Twilio webhook API endpoints (e.g., under `/api/webhooks/twilio/`) are no longer publicly accessible or active on Vercel.
2.  The `twilio` package is moved from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` in `package.json` to exclude it from production builds.
3.  The application builds and deploys successfully without the Twilio functionality.
4.  A full regression test is performed, confirming that deactivating the Twilio code has introduced no side effects to the core PWA application (Authentication, Daily Ritual, etc.).
5.  A note is added to the `README.md` explaining the status of the Twilio code.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Deactivate Vercel Functions** (AC: #1)
    - [ ] Rename the `api/webhooks/twilio/` directory to `_api/webhooks/twilio/`. The leading underscore will prevent Vercel from deploying its contents as active API routes.
- [ ] **Task 2: Update Dependencies** (AC: #2)
    - [ ] Modify the `package.json` file to move the `twilio` package from the `dependencies` section to `devDependencies`.
    - [ ] Run `npm install` to update the `package-lock.json` file.
- [ ] **Task 3: Update Documentation** (AC: #5)
    - [ ] Add a section to the `README.md` file titled "Twilio Functionality" explaining that the SMS/IVR code is currently disabled but preserved in the `_api/` directory for future use.
- [ ] **Task 4: Perform Regression Testing** (AC: #3, #4)
    - [ ] After the changes are made, run the full suite of automated tests (`npm test`) to ensure they all pass.
    - [ ] Perform a manual end-to-end test of the complete PWA user flow (Login -> Daily Ritual -> Logout) in a preview environment.

### Dev Notes
* This story acts as a clean "off-switch" for the legacy Twilio features.
* It intentionally avoids deep refactoring of the `ConversationEngine` or making database schema changes. This preserves the code in a state where it can be more easily re-enabled in the future if needed.
