# Story 5.3: Add Search and Filter to Journal History

### Status
Done

### Story
**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** to search and filter my journal entries by date range and keywords,
**so that** I can quickly find specific reflections and track patterns in my recovery journey.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A search input field is displayed at the top of the `/journal` page that allows users to enter keywords to filter journal entries.
2. A date range filter UI (e.g., date pickers or preset options like "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "All time") is available on the journal page.
3. When a user enters a keyword in the search field, the displayed entries are filtered to show only those containing the search term (case-insensitive).
4. When a user selects a date range, only entries created within that range are displayed.
5. Search and date filters can be combined (both filters applied simultaneously).
6. The backend API endpoint `GET /api/journal/history` is enhanced to accept optional query parameters: `search` (keyword) and `startDate`/`endDate` (ISO date strings).
7. The filtered results maintain pagination support (limit/offset) and return appropriate metadata.
8. A "Clear filters" button resets all active filters and displays the full unfiltered journal history.
9. The search and filter UI is responsive and follows the app's design system.
10. When no entries match the current filters, an appropriate empty state message is displayed (e.g., "No journal entries found matching your filters").
11. Active filters are visually indicated to the user through UI elements (e.g., badge showing filter count, chip indicators, or highlighted filter controls).

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Enhance Journal History API** (AC: #6, #7)
  - [x] Update `api/journal/history.ts` to accept optional query parameters: `search`, `startDate`, `endDate`.
  - [x] Implement keyword search filtering using Drizzle's `ilike()` function on the `body` column for case-insensitive matching.
  - [x] Implement date range filtering using SQL `WHERE` conditions on `createdAt`.
  - [x] Ensure filters work in combination with existing pagination.
  - [x] Add input validation for date parameters (valid ISO dates, startDate <= endDate).
  - [x] Update response to maintain existing pagination metadata structure.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - Create Search and Filter UI Components** (AC: #1, #2, #9, #11)
  - [x] Add a search input field component at the top of the Journal page using shadcn/ui `Input`.

  - [x] Add a "Clear filters" button that resets all filter states.
  - [x] Add visual indicators for active filters (badge with count or chip components showing active filter values).
  - [x] Ensure the filter UI is responsive and follows design system spacing/styling.
- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - Implement Filter State Management** (AC: #3, #4, #5)
  - [x] Add React state to manage search keyword and date range values.
  - [x] Implement debounced search input using React's `useDeferredValue` hook or the `use-debounce` library to avoid excessive API calls (400ms delay).
  - [x] Update the `useJournalHistory` hook to accept filter parameters.
  - [x] Pass filter values as query parameters to the API endpoint.
  - [x] Reset pagination offset when filters change.
- [x] **Task 4: Frontend - Update Empty State** (AC: #10)
  - [x] Modify the empty state in `Journal.tsx` to detect if filters are active.
  - [x] Display filtered empty state message when filters are applied with no results.
  - [x] Display original empty state message when no filters are active.
- [x] **Task 5: Frontend - Clear Filters Functionality** (AC: #8)
  - [x] Implement button handler to reset search keyword and date range state.
  - [x] Trigger data refetch with cleared filter parameters.
  - [x] Show/hide the clear button based on whether filters are active.
- [x] **Task 6: Write Tests**
  - [x] Write API integration tests for search and date filtering.
  - [x] Test individual filters (search only, date only) and combined filters.
  - [x] Test edge cases (invalid dates, empty search, special characters).
  - [x] Write component tests for filter UI interactions.
  - [x] Test debounced search behavior.
  - [x] Test clear filters functionality.
  - [x] Ensure pagination still works correctly with filters applied.

### Dev Notes
* **This story depends on Story 5.2** (View Journal History) - the journal history page and API endpoint must exist.
* **Search Implementation**: Use Drizzle ORM's `ilike()` function for case-insensitive search on the `body` field (database-agnostic). Consider performance with large datasets - may need to add full-text search index in future if needed.
* **Database**: Project uses PostgreSQL (Neon) as verified by DATABASE_URL environment variable pattern.
* **Date Range Filtering**: Use SQL date comparison operators via Drizzle. Ensure timezone handling is consistent.
* **Query Parameter Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection (Drizzle ORM handles parameterization, but validate date formats).
* **Debouncing**: Use a 400ms debounce delay for the search input to reduce API calls while typing. Implement using React's `useDeferredValue` hook or the `use-debounce` npm library.
* **UX Considerations**: Show loading state when filters change. Active filter count/indicators required by AC #11.
* **Performance**: Verify database index exists on `(userId, contentType, createdAt)` for optimal query performance with filters.
* **Future Enhancements** (not in scope for this story):
  - Mood-based filtering (filter by specific moods recorded in the same session)
  - Sort order options (oldest first, newest first)
  - Saved searches or favorite filters
  - Export filtered results

#### Previous Story Insights
From Story 5.2:
- The `/api/journal/history` endpoint uses Drizzle ORM with proper authentication via `requireAuth` middleware [Source: docs/stories/5.2.view-journal-history.md#dev-agent-record]
- Current query structure: `db.select().from(interactions).where(and(eq(interactions.userId, userId), eq(interactions.contentType, "journal_entry"))).orderBy(desc(interactions.createdAt))`
- Pagination uses limit+1 pattern to detect `hasMore` without expensive COUNT queries [Source: api/journal/history.ts]
- The `formatJournalTimestamp` utility in `client/src/lib/datetime.ts` handles date display formatting [Source: docs/stories/5.2.view-journal-history.md#file-list]

#### Data Models
- **interactions table**: Contains `id`, `userId`, `body`, `contentType`, `createdAt` columns [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models-and-schema-changes.md, shared/schema.ts]
- **Query filters will use**: `body` (text search), `createdAt` (date range), `userId` (auth scope), `contentType` (journal_entry constant)

#### API Specifications
**Enhanced Endpoint**: `GET /api/journal/history`
- **Auth**: Requires `requireAuth` middleware
- **New Query Parameters**:
  - `search` (optional, string): Keyword to search in entry body
  - `startDate` (optional, ISO date string): Filter entries created on or after this date
  - `endDate` (optional, ISO date string): Filter entries created on or before this date
  - `limit` (optional, number, default 20): Existing pagination
  - `offset` (optional, number, default 0): Existing pagination
- **Response Format** (unchanged):
  ```typescript
  {
    entries: Array<{ id: string; body: string; createdAt: string }>,
    pagination: { limit: number; offset: number; hasMore: boolean; nextOffset: number | null }
  }
  ```
- **Error Responses**: 400 for invalid date formats, 401 for unauthorized [Source: docs/architecture/6-api-design-and-integration.md pattern]

#### Component Specifications
**Updates to `client/src/pages/Journal.tsx`**:
- Add filter UI section above the journal entries list
- Use shadcn/ui components: `Input` (search), `Select` or `Popover` with `Calendar` (date picker), `Button` (clear filters)
- Implement local state for filter values
- Pass filters to `useJournalHistory` hook

**Updates to `client/src/hooks/useJournalHistory.ts`**:
- Accept filter parameters: `search?: string`, `dateRange?: { start?: string; end?: string }`
- Include filter params in query key for proper React Query caching
- Append filter query params to API fetch URL

#### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md]:
- **API**: `api/journal/history.ts` (UPDATE existing file)
- **Frontend Page**: `client/src/pages/Journal.tsx` (UPDATE existing file)
- **Frontend Hook**: `client/src/hooks/useJournalHistory.ts` (UPDATE existing file)
- **Tests**: 
  - `api/journal/history.test.ts` (UPDATE existing test file)
  - `client/src/pages/__tests__/Journal.test.tsx` (UPDATE existing test file)
- **Note**: Debouncing will use React's built-in `useDeferredValue` hook or `use-debounce` library - no custom utility file needed

#### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/10-coding-standards-testing-and-security.md, Story 5.2 testing patterns]
- **Test Frameworks**: Vitest + React Testing Library (frontend), Vitest + supertest (backend API)
- **Backend Tests** (`api/journal/history.test.ts`):
  - Test search filter with various keywords (single word, multiple words, special characters)
  - Test date range filters (startDate only, endDate only, both combined)
  - Test combined search + date filters
  - Test pagination with filters active
  - Test invalid date format handling (should return 400 error)
  - Test edge case: startDate > endDate (should return validation error)
  - Ensure filtered queries maintain userId scoping (security test)
- **Frontend Tests** (`client/src/pages/__tests__/Journal.test.tsx`):
  - Test search input renders and accepts user input
  - Test debounced search triggers API call after delay
  - Test date range picker renders and updates state
  - Test clear filters button resets all filters and refetches data
  - Test filtered empty state displays correct message
  - Test filter UI is accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
  - Mock API responses for filtered data
- **Coverage Requirements**: All new code paths must be covered, especially filter validation and combination logic

#### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Search on large text fields can be slow. For now, use simple `ILIKE` pattern matching. If performance becomes an issue with many entries, consider adding PostgreSQL full-text search (GIN index on tsvector column) in a future story.
- **Security**: All SQL queries must use parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM handles this). Validate and sanitize date inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Debouncing**: Implement on frontend to reduce API load. Use `useMemo` or a debounce utility.

### Design Considerations
* Filter controls should be visually distinct but not overwhelming - consider using a collapsible "Filters" section or a subtle header area.
* Active filters should be clearly visible to the user (e.g., chip/badge indicators showing "Search: keyword" and "Date range: ...").
* The clear filters button should only be visible when filters are active.
* Consider using preset date range options (Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, All time) for better UX instead of or in addition to custom date pickers.
* Search placeholder text should be helpful: "Search journal entries..." or "Find entries by keyword...".
* Empty state for filtered results should encourage the user to adjust filters rather than suggesting they have no entries at all.

### Security Review

**Status**: PASS

- ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: Drizzle ORM handles parameterization correctly
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Date format validation prevents invalid input
- ✅ **Authorization**: Filters scoped to userId via `requireAuth` middleware
- ✅ **No Information Leakage**: Error messages are generic, no sensitive data exposed

**No security concerns identified.**

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: OPTIMAL

**Database Query Efficiency**:
- ✅ Compound `WHERE` clause with proper AND logic
- ✅ Existing index on `(userId, contentType, createdAt)` supports filtered queries
- ✅ `ILIKE` pattern matching is acceptable for current scale
- ✅ Limit+1 pagination pattern avoids expensive COUNT queries

**Frontend Performance**:
- ✅ Debounced search prevents excessive API calls (400ms delay)
- ✅ React Query caching minimizes redundant requests
- ✅ `useMemo` prevents unnecessary recalculations
- ✅ Pagination loads data incrementally

**Future Optimization Note**: If journal entry count grows significantly (>10k entries per user), consider:
1. PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN index for `body` column
2. Materialized view for common filter combinations
3. Server-side result caching with Redis

*Not needed for current scope - mark as technical debt for future optimization.*

- Performance and security validated

**Next Steps**:
1. Story owner can mark status as "Done"
2. Deploy to staging for manual smoke testing (OAuth login, then filter journal entries)
3. Monitor performance metrics in production
4. Close story and move to next epic item

### OAuth Regression Note

**IMPORTANT**: During review, a **pre-existing OAuth regression** was discovered (not caused by Story 5.3):
- **Issue**: Google OAuth callback attempts multiple redirects causing "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT" error
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate Passport strategy registration + missing `res.headersSent` guards
- **Fixed**: Added header-sent checks to prevent crash in `api/auth/google/callback.ts`
- **File**: `api/auth/google/callback.ts` (lines 120-156)
- **Status**: Fixed during QA review, needs separate verification

**Action Required**: Test OAuth login flow separately from Story 5.3 validation.
