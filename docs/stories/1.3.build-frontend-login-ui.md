### Status
Done

### QA Approval
- **QA Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Approved By**: Quinn (Test Architect)
- **Quality Gate**: PASS (95/100)
- **Merge Commit**: 565b006

### Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to see a clear "Sign in with Google" option and be able to initiate the login process,  
**so that** I can securely access the application using my Google account.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The existing `client/src/pages/Login.tsx` is refactored to replace email/password fields with Google OAuth login.
2.  A route for `/login` already exists in `client/src/App.tsx` and correctly renders the updated `LoginPage` component.
3.  The `/login` page displays a "Sign in with Google" button that is visually consistent with the `shadcn/ui` theme and includes the Google logo/icon.
4.  Clicking the "Sign in with Google" button navigates the user's browser to the backend's `GET /api/auth/google` endpoint, thereby initiating the Google OAuth flow.
5.  The login page is responsive and displays correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
6.  The "Get Started" button on the `Landing.tsx` page (via `Hero.tsx` component) links to the `/login` page.
7.  The login page includes appropriate loading states and error handling for edge cases.
8.  The page maintains visual consistency with the calming, recovery-focused design system (soft colors, clear typography, accessible contrasts).

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Refactor the Login Page Component** (AC: #1, #3, #5, #8)
    - [x] Remove existing email/password form fields from `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`.
    - [x] Replace with a centered card layout using `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`).
    - [x] Add a welcoming title (e.g., "Welcome to Next Moment") and supportive description text.
    - [x] Create a prominent "Sign in with Google" button with Google branding (consider using Lucide's `Chrome` icon or a custom Google SVG).
    - [x] Ensure the button has proper hover states, accessibility attributes (aria-label), and focus styles.
    - [x] Style the page to match the calming aesthetic from `Landing.tsx` (reuse `Header` and `Footer` components if appropriate).
    - [x] Test responsive behavior on mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) viewports.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement the OAuth Initiation Action** (AC: #4)
    - [x] Convert the "Sign in with Google" button to either:
      - Option A: A standard anchor tag (`<a href="/api/auth/google">`) styled as a button, OR
      - Option B: A button with `onClick` that performs `window.location.href = '/api/auth/google'`
    - [x] Ensure the navigation is a full-page redirect (not a SPA navigation) to allow Passport.js to handle the OAuth flow.
    - [x] Add optional loading state if using button approach (disable button and show spinner while redirecting).
- [x] **Task 3: Verify and Update Application Routing** (AC: #2, #6)
    - [x] Confirm the `/login` route is correctly configured in `client/src/App.tsx` (route already exists, just verify).
    - [x] Locate the "Get Started" button in `client/src/components/Hero.tsx`.
    - [x] Verify it links to `/login` (if it currently links to `/check-in`, update the route).
    - [x] Test navigation flow: Landing → Login → OAuth redirect.
- [x] **Task 4: Add Error Handling and Edge Cases** (AC: #7)
    - [x] Add URL parameter parsing to detect error states (e.g., `?error=auth_failed`).
    - [x] Display user-friendly error messages using `shadcn/ui` Alert component if error parameters are present.
    - [x] Handle the case where the user is already authenticated (optional: redirect to `/daily-ritual` automatically).
- [x] **Task 5: Write Tests**
    - [x] Create or update test file: `client/src/pages/Login.test.tsx`.
    - [x] Test: Component renders with "Sign in with Google" button.
    - [x] Test: Button includes correct href or onClick handler pointing to `/api/auth/google`.
    - [x] Test: Component is responsive (snapshot tests for different viewport sizes).
    - [x] Test: Error message displays when `?error` query param is present.
    - [x] Test: Accessibility - button has proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation works.
    - [x] Use Vitest + React Testing Library as per project standards.

### Dev Notes

#### Dependencies
* **Prerequisite**: Story 1.2 (Backend Google OAuth Callback) must be complete and deployed.
* **Backend Endpoints Available**:
  - `GET /api/auth/google` - Initiates OAuth flow (redirects to Google)
  - `GET /api/auth/google/callback` - Handles callback and sets `auth_token` cookie
  - Cookie-based authentication is now working (verified in Story 1.2 hotfix)

└── App.tsx                # Route configuration (already has /login route)
```

#### Key Implementation Notes from Story 1.2
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - OAuth initiation: User clicks button → Full page redirect to `/api/auth/google`
   - Passport.js handles Google redirect and callback
   - On success: JWT set as `HttpOnly` cookie → User redirected to `/daily-ritual`
   - On error: User redirected to `/login?error=auth_failed`

2. **Cookie-Based Auth**:
   - JWT stored in `auth_token` cookie (HttpOnly, Secure in production, SameSite=lax)
   - Cookie lifetime: 7 days
   - All API requests use `credentials: 'include'` to send cookies

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - No client-side token storage needed (cookies handled automatically)
   - CSRF protection via Passport.js `state` parameter
   - Use HTTPS in production (Secure flag enforced)

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Backend redirects to `/login?error=auth_failed` on OAuth errors
   - Backend redirects to `/login?error=no_email` if Google profile missing email
   - Frontend should parse query params and display appropriate error messages

#### UI/UX Design Guidelines
* **Visual Consistency**: Match the calming, recovery-focused aesthetic from Landing page
* **Color Palette**: Use soft, trustworthy colors (blues, greens, neutrals)
* **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with adequate spacing
* **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance (contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
* **Mobile-First**: Design for small screens first, then scale up
* **Supportive Language**: Use encouraging, non-judgmental copy (e.g., "Welcome back" vs "Log in")

#### Component Architecture Pattern
```tsx
// Recommended structure for Login.tsx
<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
  <Header />
  <main className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md mx-4">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome to Next Moment</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>Sign in to continue your journey</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {error && <Alert variant="destructive">...</Alert>}
        <Button asChild className="w-full">
          <a href="/api/auth/google">
            <ChromeIcon className="mr-2" />
            Sign in with Google
          </a>
        </Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  </main>
  <Footer />
</div>
```

#### Testing Standards
* **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
* **Test File Location**: `client/src/pages/Login.test.tsx` (co-located with component)
* **Test Coverage Requirements**:
  - Unit tests: Component rendering, button behavior, error states
  - Integration tests: Navigation flow, query parameter parsing
  - Accessibility tests: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
  - Responsive tests: Viewport-specific rendering (optional snapshot tests)
* **Mocking Strategy**:
  - Mock `window.location.href` for navigation tests
  - Mock `useSearchParams` for query parameter tests
  - Use `@testing-library/user-event` for user interaction simulation
* **Test Standards**:
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Use semantic queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) over `getByTestId`
  - Test user-facing behavior, not implementation details
  - Ensure all tests pass before marking story complete

#### Scope Boundaries
* **In Scope**:
  - Refactoring Login.tsx for Google OAuth UI
  - OAuth flow initiation (redirect to backend)
  - Error message display
  - Visual design and responsiveness
  - Unit and integration tests

* **Out of Scope** (Story 1.4):
  - Protected route implementation
  - Logout functionality
  - Global auth state management with `useAuth` hook
  - Automatic redirect for authenticated users
  - Token refresh logic

#### Known Issues from Story 1.2 (Resolved)
- ✅ JWT signature mismatch - Fixed by adding `dotenv.config()` to API handlers
- ✅ Database enum missing 'daily-ritual' - Fixed by migration (commit c2b654c)
- ✅ Placeholder token conflict - Fixed by removing hardcoded token from client

#### Reference Documents
* PRD: `docs/prd/2-requirements.md` (FR1, FR2, NFR1, NFR4, NFR5, NFR6)
* Architecture: `docs/architecture/5-component-architecture.md` (LoginPage component)
* Story 1.2: `docs/stories/1.2.implement-backend-oauth-callback.md` (Backend integration details)

### Given-When-Then Test Scenarios

All critical flows have test coverage mapped to Given-When-Then patterns:

```gherkin
# AC#1, #3: Login Page Rendering
Given a user navigates to /login
When the page loads
Then they should see "Welcome to Next Moment"
And they should see a "Sign in with Google" button with Google icon
And the page should include Header and Footer components

# AC#4: OAuth Flow Initiation
Given a user is on the login page
When they click the "Sign in with Google" button
Then the browser should redirect to /api/auth/google
And the button should show a loading state with "Redirecting..."
And the button should be disabled during redirect

# AC#7: Error Handling - Auth Failed
Given the OAuth flow failed on the backend
When the user is redirected to /login?error=auth_failed
Then they should see an error alert
And the error message should say "Authentication failed. Please try again."
And the error should clear from URL after 5 seconds

# AC#7: Error Handling - No Email
Given the Google account has no email
When the user is redirected to /login?error=no_email
Then they should see "Your Google account must have an email address."

# AC#7: Error Handling - User Cancelled
Given the user cancels OAuth on Google's consent screen
When redirected to /login?error=cancelled
Then they should see "Sign in was cancelled. Please try again when you're ready."

# AC#5: Responsive Design
Given a user views the page on mobile (320px)
When the page renders
Then the button should be full-width
And the card should have proper max-width constraint
And the layout should remain readable

# AC#6: Navigation from Landing
Given a user is on the Landing page
When they click the "Get Started" button
Then they should navigate to /login

# AC#8: Visual Consistency
Given a user views the login page
When comparing to the Landing page
Then the background should use bg-muted/30
And the design should feel calming and recovery-focused
And the language should be supportive and non-judgmental
```

**All scenarios are covered by the 19-test suite.**

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Overall Risk Level: LOW**

| Risk Category | Count | Severity | Must Fix Before Production |
|---------------|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| Critical | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| High | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Medium | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Low | 2 | Low | Recommended for future PR |

**Low-Risk Items (Optional Improvements):**

1. **useEffect Cleanup (LOW)**
   - Current: Error timer doesn't cleanup on unmount
   - Impact: Potential memory leak if component unmounts within 5 seconds
   - Likelihood: Very low (user unlikely to navigate away so quickly)
   - Recommendation: Add cleanup in future PR for completeness

2. **Visual Regression Testing (LOW)**
   - Current: No visual regression tests (Chromatic/Percy)
   - Impact: Manual verification needed for design consistency
   - Likelihood: Low impact (comprehensive functional tests exist)
   - Recommendation: Consider for future if design system scales
