# Story 1.3: Build Frontend Login UI & Initiate Flow

### Status
Draft

### Story
As a user, I want to see a clear 'Sign in with Google' option and be able to initiate the login process, so that I can access the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new page component is created at `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`.
2.  A new route for `/login` is added to the main router in `client/src/App.tsx`.
3.  The `/login` page displays a "Sign in with Google" button that is visually consistent with the `shadcn/ui` theme.
4.  Clicking the "Sign in with Google" button navigates the user's browser to the backend's `GET /api/auth/google` endpoint, thereby initiating the Google OAuth flow.
5.  The login page is responsive and displays correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
6.  The "Get Started" button on the `Landing.tsx` page is updated to link to the new `/login` page.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create the Login Page Component** (AC: #1, #3, #5)
    - [ ] Create the new file `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`.
    - [ ] Use `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Button`, etc.) to build a simple, centered login prompt.
    - [ ] The page should have a clear title (e.g., "Welcome Back") and a primary "Sign in with Google" button.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement the Login Action** (AC: #4)
    - [ ] The `onClick` handler for the login button should perform a full-page navigation to `/api/auth/google`. A standard HTML anchor tag (`<a>`) is sufficient.
- [ ] **Task 3: Update Application Routing** (AC: #2, #6)
    - [ ] In `client/src/App.tsx`, add a new `<Route>` for the `/login` path that renders the `LoginPage` component.
    - [ ] In `client/src/components/Hero.tsx`, find the "Get Started" `<Button>` and change its `Link` wrapper to point to `/login` instead of `/check-in`.
- [ ] **Task 4: Write Tests**
    - [ ] Create a new test file for the `LoginPage` component.
    - [ ] Write a test to verify that the component renders the "Sign in with Google" button.
    - [ ] Write a test to confirm that clicking the button attempts to navigate to the correct backend URL.

### Dev Notes
* This story is dependent on **Story 1.2 (Backend Google OAuth Callback)** being complete.
* This story focuses *only* on initiating the login flow. The handling of the redirect *back* from the backend is covered in subsequent stories.
* The UI should be visually consistent with the existing `Landing.tsx` page, reusing the `Header` and `Footer` components if appropriate.
