### **Story 1: User & Session Schema**

**User Story:**
As a developer, I need a database schema to store user information, session logs, and messages, so that we can build the core application features.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** This story modifies the existing PostgreSQL database. It builds upon the Drizzle ORM setup in `server/storage.ts`.
*   **Technology:** Neon PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, TypeScript.
*   **Follows pattern:** Adheres to the data models defined in `docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md`.
*   **Touch points:**
    *   `shared/schema.ts` will be updated.
    *   A new migration file will be generated by Drizzle Kit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new Drizzle migration is generated.
2.  The `users` table schema is updated to include a `phoneNumber` field.
3.  New `sessions` and `messages` tables are created with the exact columns, types, and constraints specified in `docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md`.
4.  The migration is successfully applied to the development database without errors.
5.  All new table schemas are reflected in the Drizzle client.

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** Use Drizzle Kit (`drizzle-kit generate` and `drizzle-kit push`) to manage and apply the schema changes.
*   **Existing Pattern Reference:** The schema definitions should follow the existing style in `shared/schema.ts`.
*   **Key Constraints:** The table and column names must match the architecture document precisely to ensure compatibility with future stories.

**Definition of Done:**
*   [ ] Drizzle migration is created and successfully applied.
*   [ ] The resulting database schema perfectly matches the specification in the architecture documents.
*   [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved by the Architect.
