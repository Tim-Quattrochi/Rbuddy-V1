### **Story 7: IVR Webhook & Basic Flow**

**User Story:**
As a user who prefers voice calls, I want to be able to call a designated number and have the system answer and greet me, so that I can begin my daily check-in.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** This story creates a new entry point for voice calls, parallel to the existing SMS webhook.
*   **Technology:** Vercel Serverless Functions, TypeScript, Twilio SDK.
*   **Follows pattern:** Implements a new webhook handler for voice, similar in structure to the SMS handler, as described in `docs/architecture/component-architecture.md`.
*   **Touch points:**
    *   A new file will be created at `api/webhooks/twilio/voice.ts`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new Vercel API route is created at `/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`.
2.  The webhook handler validates the `x-twilio-signature` for all incoming voice call requests from Twilio.
3.  When a valid call is received, the system answers it and responds with TwiML.
4.  The TwiML response uses the `<Say>` verb to play a welcome message (e.g., "Welcome to your Reentry Buddy daily check-in.").
5.  After playing the welcome message, the TwiML response uses the `<Gather>` verb to collect DTMF input. The `action` for the `<Gather>` verb should point to a new endpoint, `/api/webhooks/twilio/voice/gather`.
6.  The initial mood prompt is included within the `<Gather>` verb using `<Say>` (e.g., "How are you feeling? Press 1 for Calm, 2 for Stressed, 3 for Tempted, or 4 for Hopeful.").

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** Use the `twilio` Node.js helper library to generate the `VoiceResponse` TwiML. The webhook URL will need to be configured in the Twilio phone number settings for incoming calls.
*   **Existing Pattern Reference:** The structure of this voice webhook handler should mirror the security and validation patterns of the SMS webhook handler.
*   **Key Constraints:** This story focuses only on answering the call and prompting for the first input. The processing of the DTMF input will be handled in the next story.

**Definition of Done:**
*   [ ] An incoming call to the Twilio number triggers the `/api/webhooks/twilio/voice` endpoint.
*   [ ] The system answers the call and plays the correct welcome and mood prompt messages.
*   [ ] The call remains active, waiting for user input.
*   [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved by the Architect.
