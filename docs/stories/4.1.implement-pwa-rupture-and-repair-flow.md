# Story 4.1: Implement PWA Rupture & Repair Flow

### Status
Ready for Review

### Story
As a user who has experienced a relapse, I want to be able to report a 'slip' within the app and receive immediate, compassionate support, so that I can re-engage with my recovery without shame.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A clearly visible "I slipped" button or link is available in a persistent part of the authenticated UI (e.g., the Header).
2. Clicking the button initiates the Rupture & Repair flow, displayed in a full-screen modal or on a dedicated page.
3. The flow begins by calling a new protected endpoint at `POST /api/repair/start`.
4. On the backend, a new `sessions` record is created with `flowType: 'repair'`.
5. The user's daily streak is gracefully reset.
6. The UI presents the user with an immediate, empathetic message, followed by options to identify a trigger (e.g., "Stress," "People," "Craving").
7. After selecting a trigger, the user is shown a simple, actionable "repair suggestion" based on their selection.
8. The flow concludes with a supportive closing message, and the user is returned to the main dashboard.

### Dependencies
- **REQUIRES**: Epic 1 (Authentication) must be completed
- **REQUIRES**: Story 1.5 (Daily Ritual PWA Backend Integration) must be completed
- The `useAuth` hook must be available at `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- The `ConversationEngine` service must be functional at `server/services/conversationEngine.ts`
- Backend OAuth flow must be functional

### Technical Context

**Authentication Implementation** (from Story 1.4):
- **Middleware Location**: `server/middleware/auth.ts` (exports `requireAuth` function)
- **Hook Location**: `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Authentication Method**: HTTP-only cookie-based (`auth_token` cookie)
- **User Data Access**: Available in `req.userId` after `requireAuth` middleware

**ConversationEngine Pattern** (from Story 1.5):
- Similar to `handlePwaMoodSelection` method
- Location: `server/services/conversationEngine.ts`
- Returns session data and content to frontend
- Creates session with proper flow type and channel
- Logs interactions for each user action

**Frontend State Management**:
- Uses TanStack Query for API calls (`useMutation` for mutations)
- Reference implementation: `client/src/pages/DailyRitual.tsx`
- Query invalidation pattern: `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['userStats'])` (updates streak display)

### API Contract

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/repair/start`

**Authentication:** Required (uses `requireAuth` middleware)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "trigger": "stress" | "people" | "craving"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid-string",
  "message": "Slips happen. What matters is what you do next.",
  "repairSuggestion": "Take 3 deep breaths right now."
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized`: User not authenticated
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid trigger value
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Database or server error

### Data Model

**Sessions Table:**
- Existing `flowType` enum already includes `'repair'` value (verify in `shared/schema.ts`)
- New session created with:
  - `flowType: 'repair'`
  - `channel: 'pwa'`
  - `userId`: from authenticated user
- No schema changes needed for sessions table

**Interactions Table:**
- Use existing `contentType: 'text'` for repair flow interactions
- Trigger selection: `contentType: 'text'`, body contains trigger value
- Repair suggestion: `contentType: 'text'`, body contains suggestion text
- No schema migration needed - use existing enum values

**User Stats (Streak Reset):**
- Streak is **calculated dynamically** from sessions table (see `api/user/stats.ts`)
- No column update needed - streak resets automatically when new `repair` session is created
- The repair session breaks the consecutive daily-ritual chain
- `calculateStreak()` function will return 0 when detecting repair session gap

**Repair Suggestions (Hardcoded Mapping):**
- Stored in `ConversationEngine` (similar to affirmations)
- Location: `server/services/conversationEngine.ts`
- Mapping:
  - `"stress"` → `"Take 3 deep breaths right now."`
  - `"people"` → `"Text or call someone who supports your recovery."`
  - `"craving"` → `"Drink a glass of water and step outside."`

### Message Copy

**Source:** `docs/front-end-spec.md` (lines 229-278, 475-522)

**Initial Message (AC#6):**
```
"Slips happen. What matters is what you do next."
```

**Trigger Selection Prompt:**
```
"What triggered this moment?"
```
**Trigger Options:**
- "Stress"
- "People"
- "Craving"

**Closing Message (AC#8):**
```
"We're here with you. Come back tomorrow for your check-in."
```

**Button Text:**
- Header button: `"I slipped"`
- Complete flow button: `"Done"`

### Edge Cases to Handle

**Multiple Slips Same Day:**
- Allow user to access repair flow multiple times per day
- Show same compassionate flow each time
- Do NOT display error or judgmental message

**Streak Already at Zero:**
- Still create repair session
- Do NOT error or skip flow
- User still gets compassionate support

**API Call Failure:**
- Show error toast: "We couldn't save your session. Please try again."
- Do NOT reset streak if API fails
- Keep repair modal open so user can retry

**Network Offline:**
- Show message: "You're offline. Your session will be saved when you reconnect."
- Queue for background sync (future enhancement - OK to defer for MVP)

**User Not Yet Checked In:**
- User can still access repair flow even if they've never done a daily ritual
- This is intentional - support should always be available

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Backend - Create Repair API Endpoint** (AC: #3, #4, #5)
    - [x] Create the new API route file `api/repair/start.ts` and protect it with the `requireAuth` middleware.
    - [x] Implement the backend logic to create a `sessions` record with `flowType: 'repair'`.
    - [x] Implement the logic to reset the user's streak count.
- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - Build UI Components** (AC: #1, #2, #6, #7, #8)
    - [x] Create a new component (e.g., `client/src/components/repair/RepairFlow.tsx`) to manage the state of the multi-step flow.
    - [x] Add an "I slipped" button to the `Header.tsx` component, visible only to authenticated users.
- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - Integrate State and API**
    - [x] Clicking the "I slipped" button should trigger the display of the `RepairFlow` component.
    - [x] Use TanStack Query's `useMutation` to call the `POST /api/repair/start` endpoint when the flow begins.
    - [x] After the flow is complete, invalidate the user stats query to refetch the updated (reset) streak.
- [x] **Task 4: Write Tests**
    - [x] Write unit tests for the `RepairFlow` component, covering its different steps.
    - [x] Write integration tests for the `POST /api/repair/start` endpoint to verify session creation and streak reset.

### Test Scenarios

**Unit Tests - RepairFlow Component** (`client/src/components/repair/RepairFlow.test.tsx`):
1. **Renders Initial State**
   - Given: RepairFlow component is mounted
   - When: Component renders
   - Then: Initial empathetic message is displayed
   - And: Three trigger option buttons are visible ("Stress", "People", "Craving")

2. **Submits Trigger Selection**
   - Given: RepairFlow is rendered
   - When: User clicks "Stress" button
   - Then: API call to `POST /api/repair/start` is triggered with `{ trigger: "stress" }`
   - And: Loading state is shown during API call

3. **Displays Repair Suggestion**
   - Given: API call succeeds with repair suggestion
   - When: Response is received
   - Then: Repair suggestion text is displayed
   - And: "Done" button is visible

4. **Shows Closing Message**
   - Given: User is on repair suggestion screen
   - When: User clicks "Done"
   - Then: Closing supportive message is displayed
   - And: User can close modal/return to dashboard

5. **Handles API Error Gracefully**
   - Given: RepairFlow is rendered
   - When: API call fails with 500 error
   - Then: Error toast is displayed
   - And: User can retry trigger selection
   - And: Streak is NOT reset (verified via stats query)

**Integration Tests - POST /api/repair/start** (`api/repair/start.test.ts`):
1. **Creates Repair Session Successfully**
   - Given: Authenticated user with userId
   - When: POST /api/repair/start with `{ trigger: "stress" }`
   - Then: Response 200 with sessionId and repairSuggestion
   - And: New session created with `flowType: 'repair'`, `channel: 'pwa'`
   - And: Session belongs to authenticated user

2. **Logs Trigger Selection Interaction**
   - Given: Authenticated user selects trigger
   - When: API call succeeds
   - Then: Interaction logged with `contentType: 'text'`
   - And: Interaction body is `"stress"` (or selected trigger)
   - And: Interaction linked to session via `sessionId`

3. **Logs Repair Suggestion View**
   - Given: API returns repair suggestion
   - When: Response is sent
   - Then: Interaction logged with `contentType: 'text'`
   - And: Interaction body is the repair suggestion text

4. **Breaks User Streak (Dynamic Calculation)**
   - Given: User has active 5-day streak from daily-ritual sessions
   - When: POST /api/repair/start creates repair session
   - Then: GET /api/user/stats returns `streakCount: 0`
   - And: Repair session interrupts consecutive daily-ritual chain

5. **Returns Correct Repair Suggestion Mapping**
   - Given: User sends trigger "people"
   - When: API processes request
   - Then: Response contains suggestion "Text or call someone who supports your recovery."
   - (Test all three trigger → suggestion mappings)

6. **Requires Authentication (401)**
   - Given: Unauthenticated request
   - When: POST /api/repair/start without auth cookie
   - Then: Response 401 Unauthorized
   - And: No session created

7. **Validates Trigger Input (400)**
   - Given: Authenticated user
   - When: POST with invalid trigger `{ trigger: "invalid" }`
   - Then: Response 400 Bad Request
   - And: Error message indicates valid trigger values

8. **Handles Multiple Slips Same Day**
   - Given: User already has repair session today
   - When: POST /api/repair/start again
   - Then: Response 200 (no error)
   - And: New session is created (not rejected)

**Acceptance Criteria → Test Coverage Mapping**:
- AC#1 (Button visible): Manual verification / Visual regression test
- AC#2 (Modal displays): Unit test #1
- AC#3 (API endpoint): Integration tests #1-8
- AC#4 (Session created): Integration test #1
- AC#5 (Streak reset): Integration test #4
- AC#6 (Empathetic message + triggers): Unit test #1, #2
- AC#7 (Repair suggestion): Unit test #3, Integration test #5
- AC#8 (Closing message): Unit test #4

### Dev Notes
* This story implements the critical **F2** feature from the PRD.
* It is dependent on **Epic 1 (Authentication)** being complete.
* The tone and specific wording of the messages are paramount. The content should be sourced from the `docs/front-end-spec.md` and PRD to ensure it is compassionate and non-judgmental.

### UX Design Review
**Status:** Under Review (October 12, 2025)
**Issue:** Current implementation places "I slipped" button in persistent header. UX Expert Sally has identified potential emotional safety concerns with this placement.
**Action:** Alternative designs documented in `docs/ux-reviews/repair-flow-access-alternatives.md`
**Decision Pending:** Product Owner to review alternatives before Story 4.1 is marked complete.

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 12, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Executive Summary

**Gate Status: ⚠️ CONCERNS (with Product Owner decision pending)**

This is an **excellent technical implementation** with comprehensive test coverage, clean architecture, and all acceptance criteria fully met. However, the UX expert (Sally) has identified valid emotional safety concerns regarding the persistent "I slipped" button placement in the header. The implementation is production-ready from a technical perspective, but a design decision is needed before marking this story complete.

**Bottom Line:** The code is ready to merge (all tests pass, no technical issues), but Product Owner should review UX alternatives and decide whether to implement Story 4.2 immediately or accept current design for MVP.

### UX Review Integration

**Status: CONCERNS** ⚠️

**Issue Identified by UX Expert (Sally):**

The current implementation places an "I slipped" button in the persistent header (visible on every page). While this ensures accessibility, it may create:

1. **Emotional Anxiety**: Constant reminder of potential failure
2. **Cognitive Load**: Competes for attention in prime header space
3. **Tone Mismatch**: Casual placement doesn't match crisis gravity
4. **Privacy Concern**: Visible button may feel exposed

**UX Expert Recommendation:**

Implement **Story 4.2** to move access to:
- Primary: Dashboard support widget (normalizes seeking help)
- Secondary: Hamburger menu "Need Support" option (backup access)

**Comprehensive UX analysis with 5 design alternatives documented in:**
- `docs/ux-reviews/repair-flow-access-alternatives.md`
- `docs/ux-reviews/summary.md`
- `docs/stories/4.2.improve-repair-flow-accessibility.md` (ready for implementation)

**Estimated effort for Story 4.2:** 2-3 hours (low risk, reuses existing RepairFlow component)

---
