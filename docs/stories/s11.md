### **Story 11: PWA Manifest & Service Worker Setup**

**User Story:**
As a user, I want to install Reentry Buddy on my phone's home screen and use it offline, so that I can access my daily check-in ritual anytime without needing an internet connection.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** This story creates the Progressive Web App (PWA) foundation for the project. It builds upon the existing React + Vite frontend and connects to the REST API endpoints already implemented in `server/routes.ts`.
*   **Technology:** Vite, vite-plugin-pwa, Workbox, Web App Manifest, Service Workers, TypeScript.
*   **Follows pattern:** Implements PWA standards per `docs/prd.md` Section 3.2 (PWA Installation) and Section 3.3 (Offline Support).
*   **Touch points:**
    *   `vite.config.ts` will be updated to configure `vite-plugin-pwa`.
    *   `client/public/manifest.json` will be created (PWA manifest).
    *   PWA icons (192px, 512px) will be generated and placed in `client/public/`.
    *   Service worker will be auto-generated by Workbox via vite-plugin-pwa.
    *   `client/index.html` will reference the manifest.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `manifest.json` file is created at `client/public/manifest.json` with:
    - `name`: "Reentry Buddy"
    - `short_name`: "Reentry Buddy"
    - `description`: "Daily recovery support ritual"
    - `start_url`: "/"
    - `display`: "standalone"
    - `theme_color`: Wellness theme primary color from Tailwind config
    - `background_color`: Background color from Tailwind config
    - `icons`: Array with 192px and 512px icon paths
2.  PWA icons (192px and 512px) are generated and placed in `client/public/` directory.
3.  The `vite.config.ts` file is updated to include `vite-plugin-pwa` configuration with:
    - `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`
    - `includeAssets`: PWA icons
    - `manifest`: Link to manifest.json
    - Workbox `runtimeCaching` strategies:
      - **Cache-first** for static assets (JS, CSS, fonts)
      - **Network-first** for API calls (`/api/*`) with offline fallback
4.  The service worker successfully caches the app shell on first load.
5.  The PWA passes Lighthouse audit with PWA score ≥ 90.
6.  The "Add to Home Screen" prompt appears when user visits the app (on supported browsers).
7.  When installed, the PWA opens in standalone mode (no browser UI).
8.  The app loads and displays the landing page when offline (after first online visit).

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** Use `vite-plugin-pwa` to generate service worker automatically via Workbox. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Vite's build process.
*   **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow Vite plugin configuration patterns in `vite.config.ts`. Reference React 19 + Vite setup already in place.
*   **Key Constraints:**
    - Service worker must cache app shell but not API responses (those need fresh data when online).
    - Manifest must reference actual icon files that exist in `public/` directory.
    - Icons must meet PWA requirements (192px minimum, 512px recommended, square, transparent background optional).
    - Theme colors must match existing Tailwind wellness theme for brand consistency.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Task 1: Create PWA Manifest**
  - [ ] Create `client/public/manifest.json` with required fields
  - [ ] Extract theme colors from `tailwind.config.ts` for `theme_color` and `background_color`
  - [ ] Set `display: "standalone"` and `start_url: "/"`
  - [ ] Add `orientation: "portrait"` (mobile-first design)
  - [ ] Link manifest in `client/index.html` with `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">`

- [ ] **Task 2: Generate PWA Icons**
  - [ ] Create or generate 192x192px icon (maskable icon for Android)
  - [ ] Create or generate 512x512px icon (splash screen for iOS/Android)
  - [ ] Place icons in `client/public/` directory
  - [ ] Update manifest.json `icons` array with correct paths and sizes
  - [ ] Add `purpose: "any maskable"` for adaptive icons

- [ ] **Task 3: Configure vite-plugin-pwa**
  - [ ] Import `VitePWA` plugin in `vite.config.ts`
  - [ ] Configure plugin with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`
  - [ ] Set `includeAssets` to include PWA icons and manifest
  - [ ] Configure Workbox `runtimeCaching`:
    - Cache-first strategy for static assets (`.js`, `.css`, `.woff2`)
    - Network-first for API calls (`/api/*`) with 5s timeout and cache fallback
  - [ ] Set `workbox.cleanupOutdatedCaches: true`
  - [ ] Set `workbox.skipWaiting: true` for auto-updates

- [ ] **Task 4: Test PWA Installation**
  - [ ] Run `npm run build` to generate production build with service worker
  - [ ] Run `npm run preview` to test production build locally
  - [ ] Verify manifest.json is served at `/manifest.json`
  - [ ] Verify icons are served at `/icon-192x192.png` and `/icon-512x512.png`
  - [ ] Test "Add to Home Screen" prompt appears (Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest)
  - [ ] Install PWA and verify standalone mode (no browser UI)

- [ ] **Task 5: Validate Offline Functionality**
  - [ ] Open installed PWA while online
  - [ ] Turn off network in Chrome DevTools (Application → Service Workers → Offline)
  - [ ] Reload app and verify landing page displays
  - [ ] Verify service worker caches app shell correctly (Application → Cache Storage)
  - [ ] Turn network back on and verify app syncs correctly

- [ ] **Task 6: Run Lighthouse PWA Audit**
  - [ ] Open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse
  - [ ] Run PWA audit in production build (`npm run preview`)
  - [ ] Verify PWA score ≥ 90
  - [ ] Address any flagged issues (manifest, service worker, HTTPS)
  - [ ] Document Lighthouse score in Completion Notes

**Definition of Done:**
*   [ ] Manifest.json created with all required fields and correct icon references.
*   [ ] PWA icons (192px, 512px) generated and served correctly.
*   [ ] vite-plugin-pwa configured with Workbox caching strategies.
*   [ ] Service worker successfully caches app shell on first load.
*   [ ] PWA installable on Chrome/Edge (desktop and mobile).
*   [ ] Standalone mode works (no browser UI when installed).
*   [ ] App loads offline after first online visit (app shell cached).
*   [ ] Lighthouse PWA audit score ≥ 90.
*   [ ] All tasks marked [x] and documented in File List.
*   [ ] Code reviewed and follows project standards.
