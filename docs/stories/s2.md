### **Story 2: SMS Webhook Foundation**

**User Story:**
As a developer, I need a secure webhook endpoint to receive and validate incoming SMS messages from Twilio, so that the application can begin processing them.

**Story Context:**
*   **Existing System Integration:** This story creates a new entry point into the application. It does not directly integrate with existing code but will be the trigger for the `ConversationEngine` in a future story.
*   **Technology:** Vercel Serverless Functions, TypeScript, Twilio SDK.
*   **Follows pattern:** Implements the webhook handler pattern described in `docs/architecture/component-architecture.md`.
*   **Touch points:**
    *   A new file will be created at `api/webhooks/twilio/sms.ts`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new Vercel API route is created at `/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`.
2.  The webhook handler successfully validates the `x-twilio-signature` of all incoming requests using the Twilio Auth Token.
3.  Requests with an invalid signature are rejected with a `403 Forbidden` response.
4.  For this story, valid requests are acknowledged with a `200 OK` status and a basic, empty TwiML `<Response/>` message.
5.  The sender's phone number (`From`) and the message content (`Body`) are correctly extracted from the request body.
6.  The Twilio Auth Token is stored and accessed securely via environment variables.

**Technical Notes:**
*   **Integration Approach:** Use the `twilio` Node.js helper library to perform the request validation. The webhook URL will need to be configured in the Twilio phone number settings.
*   **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the webhook handler example provided in `docs/architecture/component-architecture.md`.
*   **Key Constraints:** The signature validation is critical for security and must be implemented correctly before any other logic is added.

**Definition of Done:**
*   [x] The `/api/webhooks/twilio/sms` endpoint is live and accessible.
*   [x] Signature validation correctly approves valid Twilio requests and rejects invalid ones.
*   [x] A unit test for the validation logic passes.
*   [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved by the Architect.

**Dev Agent Record:**

**Status:** Ready for Review

**File List:**
*   `api/webhooks/twilio/sms.ts` (new)
*   `api/webhooks/twilio/sms.test.ts` (new)
*   `package.json` (modified - added @vercel/node dev dependency)

**Change Log:**
*   Created Vercel serverless function for Twilio SMS webhook at `/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`.
*   Implemented Twilio signature validation using `x-twilio-signature` header.
*   Added validation to reject requests with invalid signatures (403 Forbidden).
*   Successfully extracts `From` and `Body` fields from incoming SMS.
*   Returns empty TwiML `<Response/>` for valid requests (200 OK).
*   Created comprehensive unit tests with vitest covering both valid and invalid signature scenarios.
*   All tests passing (2/2).
