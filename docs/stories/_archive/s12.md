### **Story 12: PWA Daily Ritual Flow Implementation**

**User Story:**
As a returning citizen, I want a visual daily check-in on my phone so I can ground myself, track my progress, and build a consistent positive habit.

**Story Context:**
*   **PWA Foundation:** This story builds directly on the PWA foundation established in Story 11. The service worker, manifest, and offline capabilities are assumed to be in place.
*   **Feature:** This implements the core "Daily Ritual Flow" feature as defined in the PRD [Source: `docs/prd.md`#3.1].
*   **Technology:** React, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Vercel Serverless Functions, Drizzle ORM.
*   **Touch points:**
    *   New React components will be created in `client/src/components/daily-ritual/`.
    *   A new page will be created at `client/src/pages/DailyRitual.tsx`.
    *   New API endpoints will be created under `api/daily-ritual/`.
    *   The `ConversationEngine` in `server/services/conversationEngine.ts` will be refactored to handle PWA flow logic and return JSON.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  When the user opens the PWA, they are presented with a "Daily Check-in" screen.
2.  The screen displays four large, clearly labeled mood buttons: "Calm ðŸ˜Œ", "Stressed ðŸ˜°", "Tempted ðŸ˜£", "Hopeful ðŸŒŸ".
3.  Upon tapping a mood button, an API call is made to `POST /api/daily-ritual/mood`.
4.  After selecting a mood, the user is shown an animated "Affirmation Card" component containing a supportive message relevant to their chosen mood.
5.  Below the affirmation, an optional text input field is available for the user to enter a daily intention.
6.  If the user types an intention and blurs the input, the intention is saved via an API call to `POST /api/daily-ritual/intention`.
7.  A "Streak" counter is displayed prominently on the page, which increments upon successful completion of a daily check-in. Data is fetched from `GET /api/user/stats`.
8.  The entire flow (mood selection, affirmation view, intention entry) works seamlessly offline.
9.  When offline, interactions are queued locally using the background sync capabilities established in S11. The UI provides optimistic updates.
10. All interactions are logged to the `sessions` and `interactions` tables in the database with the `channel` set to 'pwa'. [Source: `docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md`]

**Technical Notes:**
*   **API Endpoints:** The developer must implement the following REST endpoints as Vercel Serverless Functions. [Source: `docs/prd.md`#4.3]
    *   `POST /api/daily-ritual/mood`: Takes `{ userId, mood }`, returns `{ affirmation }`.
    *   `POST /api/daily-ritual/intention`: Takes `{ sessionId, intentionText }`, returns `{ success: true }`.
    *   `GET /api/user/stats`: Takes `{ userId }`, returns `{ streakCount, moodTrends }`.
*   **State Management:** Use TanStack Query to manage server state, including fetching user stats and posting mood/intention data. Leverage its features for optimistic updates to ensure a smooth offline experience. [Source: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`]
*   **Component Structure:**
    *   `MoodSelector.tsx`: A component with four `Button` components from shadcn/ui.
    *   `AffirmationCard.tsx`: A `Card` component to display the affirmation text.
    *   `IntentionInput.tsx`: An `Input` component for the daily intention.
    *   `StreakCounter.tsx`: A component to display the user's current streak.
    *   These should be organized under `client/src/components/daily-ritual/`. [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`]
*   **Conversation Engine Refactor:** The existing `conversationEngine.ts` must be adapted. Instead of returning TwiML, it should contain the core FSM logic and return JSON responses that the API routes can then send to the frontend. [Source: `docs/prd.md`#4.2]
*   **Offline-First:** The service worker configuration from S11 (Network-first for API calls) is critical. API calls made while offline must be caught by the service worker and queued for background sync. The UI should update immediately (optimistic update) and then reconcile if the background sync fails.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Task 1: Backend - API Endpoint Creation**
  - [x] Create `api/daily-ritual/mood.ts` to handle mood selection.
  - [x] Create `api/daily-ritual/intention.ts` to save the user's intention.
  - [x] Create `api/user/stats.ts` to fetch streak and other stats.
  - [x] Refactor `server/services/conversationEngine.ts` to support JSON request/response for the PWA flow.
  - [x] Ensure all endpoints validate the user's JWT and correctly log data to the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle. [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`]

- [x] **Task 2: Frontend - Component Development**
  - [x] Create `client/src/components/daily-ritual/MoodSelector.tsx`.
  - [x] Create `client/src/components/daily-ritual/AffirmationCard.tsx`.
  - [x] Create `client/src/components/daily-ritual/IntentionInput.tsx`.
  - [x] Create `client/src/components/daily-ritual/StreakCounter.tsx`.
  - [x] Ensure all new components are styled using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS to match the existing design system.

- [x] **Task 3: Frontend - Page and State Integration**
  - [x] Create the main page `client/src/pages/DailyRitual.tsx` that assembles the components from Task 2.
  - [x] Use TanStack Query's `useMutation` hook for posting mood and intention.
  - [x] Implement optimistic updates for a seamless offline experience.
  - [x] Use TanStack Query's `useQuery` hook to fetch data for the `StreakCounter`.
  - [x] Update `client/src/App.tsx` to include a route to the new `DailyRitual.tsx` page.

- [x] **Task 4: Testing**
  - [x] Write Vitest unit tests for the new React components. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
  - [x] Write Vitest integration tests for the new API endpoints, mocking database interactions.
  - [x] Manually test the entire flow in an offline environment (using browser dev tools) to confirm background sync and optimistic updates work as expected.
  - [x] Verify that data is correctly saved and updated in the Neon PostgreSQL database.

**Definition of Done:**
*   [x] All API endpoints are created, tested, and deployed on Vercel.
*   [x] All React components are created, tested, and integrated into the `DailyRitual.tsx` page.
*   [x] The full daily ritual flow is functional for online users.
*   [x] The full daily ritual flow is functional for offline users, with UI updating optimistically and data syncing in the background.
*   [x] The user's streak count updates correctly upon completion of a check-in.
*   [x] All code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes linting checks.
*   [x] All tasks are marked [x] and documented in the Dev Agent Record.
