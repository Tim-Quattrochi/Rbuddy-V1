# NFR Assessment: 5.1

Date: 2025-10-12
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - `/api/daily-ritual/intention` stays behind `requireAuth`, trims input, and frontend toasts now key off the propagated 401 status so expired sessions get the correct guidance.
- Performance: PASS - Journal save reuses the existing intention endpoint and adds only one insert per entry; no additional client renders or polling were introduced.
- Reliability: PASS - New mutation handles async errors with specific messaging, server differentiates 404 vs 500, and regression tests cover 401 journal failures.
- Maintainability: PASS - `JournalInput` is isolated with unit tests, integration coverage exercises the toast copy, and shared fetch helpers centralize error handling for future tweaks.

## Critical Issues

None.

## Quick Wins

- Consider adding a server-side max length check for journal entries to guard against exceptionally large payloads.
