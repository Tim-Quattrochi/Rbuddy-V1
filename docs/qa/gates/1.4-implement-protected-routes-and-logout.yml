top_issues:
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Story explicitly requires TanStack Query for auth state, but implementation uses React Context (AuthContext.tsx)"
    suggested_action: "Remove AuthContext.tsx and reimplement useAuth hook using TanStack Query's useQuery"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Zero test coverage for authentication functionality despite Task 4 requiring unit tests for useAuth, ProtectedRoute, and Header"
    suggested_action: "Write comprehensive test suites for all auth components before requesting re-review"

  - id: "API-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Required backend endpoints missing: GET /api/users/me and POST /api/auth/logout not found in server/routes.ts"
    suggested_action: "Implement both API endpoints in server/routes.ts with proper authentication middleware"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "/daily-ritual route completely unprotected - no ProtectedRoute component exists or is applied"

  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Unprotected routes allow complete security bypass. Logout flow incomplete. Token storage has XSS vulnerability (acceptable for MVP but needs docs)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cannot assess - TanStack Query implementation missing. Once implemented, Query provides automatic caching and request deduplication."
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "No error handling for authentication failures. No token refresh mechanism. No recovery from network failures."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Current Context approach contradicts story requirements, will require complete rewrite. Test coverage critically absent."

    rationale: "Unprotected authenticated routes allow complete authentication bypass"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement ProtectedRoute component to secure /daily-ritual"
      - "Create GET /api/users/me endpoint with authentication middleware"

      - "Rewrite useAuth hook using TanStack Query per architectural requirements"
      - "Write comprehensive test suites for all auth components"
    monitor:
      - "Token storage in localStorage (XSS risk) - document mitigation strategies"
      - "Token expiration handling (7 day expiry) - implement refresh mechanism"
