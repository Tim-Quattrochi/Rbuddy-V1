nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Routes properly protected with ProtectedRoute component. Logout flow complete with server-side cookie clearing. Uses httpOnly cookies (XSS-resistant, better than localStorage)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent TanStack Query implementation with 5-minute staleTime caching, request deduplication, and proper loading states. No unnecessary refetches."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for auth failures (network errors, 401, 500). Logout still redirects user to login even on API error (graceful degradation)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with TanStack Query as single source of truth. Excellent TypeScript types, clear interfaces, comprehensive test coverage (29 tests). Self-documenting code."
