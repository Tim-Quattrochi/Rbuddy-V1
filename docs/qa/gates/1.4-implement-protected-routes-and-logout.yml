# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.4
schema: 1
story: "1.4"
story_title: "Implement Protected Routes and Logout"
gate: "FAIL"
status_reason: "Critical blocking issues - 5/6 acceptance criteria unimplemented, wrong architectural approach used, zero test coverage for authentication code, missing required backend endpoints"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Wrong state management pattern - implemented with React Context instead of required TanStack Query approach"
    suggested_action: "Rewrite useAuth hook using TanStack Query's useQuery as specified in AC#1 and Dev Notes"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "5 out of 6 acceptance criteria completely unimplemented (AC#2, #3, #4, #5, #6)"
    suggested_action: "Implement all missing acceptance criteria before requesting review"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Zero test coverage for authentication functionality - Task 4 requires 3 test suites"
    suggested_action: "Write comprehensive unit tests for useAuth, ProtectedRoute, and Header before any production use"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "API-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Required backend endpoints missing - GET /api/users/me and POST /api/auth/logout not found in server/routes.ts"
    suggested_action: "Implement backend API endpoints before frontend implementation can function"
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Critical security gap - /daily-ritual route completely unprotected, allowing unauthorized access"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Reimplement authentication using TanStack Query pattern (not React Context)"
      - "Complete all 6 acceptance criteria implementation"
      - "Add comprehensive test coverage (3 test suites minimum)"
      - "Implement missing backend endpoints: GET /api/users/me, POST /api/auth/logout"
      - "Protect /daily-ritual route with ProtectedRoute component"

      - "Token expiration and refresh strategy"
