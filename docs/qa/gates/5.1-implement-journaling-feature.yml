      fix: "Change getByLabelText(/daily journal/i) to getByRole('textbox', { name: /daily journal/i })"
    - action: "Run npm run test to verify 16/16 tests pass"
    - action: "Mark Story 5.1 as Done after test verification"
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding character count indicator for journal entries"
    - action: "Consider adding auto-save draft functionality"
