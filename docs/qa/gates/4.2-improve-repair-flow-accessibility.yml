# Review notes
notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality. Developer demonstrated:
  - Comprehensive understanding of accessibility requirements
  - Proper test-driven development with 100% coverage
  - Clean component architecture with separation of concerns
  - Effective collaboration with UX (incorporated all feedback)
  
  UX review completed and approved. Navigation menu deferral is appropriate
  and documented. Dashboard widget is the primary access pattern, making
  menu a nice-to-have secondary enhancement for Story 4.3.
  
  No technical debt introduced. Code is production-ready without modifications.
