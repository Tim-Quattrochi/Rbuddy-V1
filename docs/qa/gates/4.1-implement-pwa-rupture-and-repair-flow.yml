# Quality Gate Decision: Story 4.1

story: "4.1"
story_title: "Implement PWA Rupture & Repair Flow"
gate: BLOCKED
status_reason: "CRITICAL PRODUCT BLOCKER: Repair flow hardcoded suggestions lack therapeutic depth and may harm user trust. Product Owner identified that current content (e.g., 'drink water and step outside' for cravings) is trivially simplistic and not evidence-based. Requires clinical validation before deployment. Technical implementation is excellent (16/16 tests passing), but content must be validated by recovery specialist."

final_verdict:
  technical_implementation: APPROVED
  ux_design: PENDING_DECISION
  code_quality: EXCELLENT
  recommendation: "Code is production-ready and can be merged. The CONCERNS gate is solely about UX button placement design choice, not code quality. Product Owner should review alternatives and decide on Story 4.2 timing."
  next_steps:
    - "Product Owner: Review docs/ux-reviews/summary.md"
    - "Product Owner: Make decision on Story 4.2 timing"
    - "Option A: Accept current design → Mark Story 4.1 as Done, merge PR"
    - "Option B: Implement Story 4.2 first → Dashboard widget + menu (2-3 hours)"
    - "Option C: Hybrid → Merge now, prioritize Story 4.2 for immediate next sprint"
