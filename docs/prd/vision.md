# 1. Vision

## 1.1 Purpose
Reentry Buddy (institutional alias *Reentry Companion*) is a digital recovery support system designed for justice-impacted individuals reentering society after incarceration.
Its mission is to provide structure, consistency, and emotional regulation through a daily ritual flow accessible on any mobile device — including basic phones.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
Justice-impacted individuals with substance use challenges often struggle with a lack of structure, high stress, and digital barriers (limited data, lost devices, low literacy).
Existing recovery apps assume smartphone access, leaving a gap for low-access users who still need daily grounding and positive feedback.

## 1.3 Solution Overview
Reentry Buddy bridges that gap through **Tier 1 accessibility** — a low-data SMS and IVR (voice) solution that enables:
- A short **Daily Ritual Flow (2–5 minutes)** via text or call.
- A **Rupture and Repair** process for relapse moments ("SLIP").
- Positive reinforcement that emphasizes progress, not failure.

## 1.4 Target Users
- **Primary Actor:** Returning citizens (justice-impacted individuals) in early-stage recovery.
- **Context:** Limited digital literacy, low trust in technology, may rely on prepaid phones.
- **Accessibility Goal:** Plain-language content written at or below a 6th-grade reading level.
