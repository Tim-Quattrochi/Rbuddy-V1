---

## Database Verification

### Schema Compliance

All database operations verified against schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`:

**Sessions Table**:
- ✅ `id` (varchar, UUID)
- ✅ `userId` (varchar, references users.id)
- ✅ `flowType` (enum: 'daily-ritual')
- ✅ `channel` (enum: 'pwa')
- ✅ `mood` (enum: calm/stressed/tempted/hopeful)
- ✅ `intention` (text, nullable)
- ✅ `streakCount` (integer, defaults to 0)
- ✅ `createdAt` (timestamp, auto-populated)

**Interactions Table**:
- ✅ `id` (varchar, UUID)
- ✅ `userId` (varchar, references users.id)
- ✅ `sessionId` (varchar, references sessions.id)
- ✅ `direction` (enum: inbound/outbound)
- ✅ `channel` (enum: 'pwa')
- ✅ `contentType` (enum: mood_selection/affirmation_view/intention)
- ✅ `body` (text)
- ✅ `status` (enum: 'synced')
- ✅ `createdAt` (timestamp, auto-populated)

---

## Method Testing

### ConversationEngine.handlePwaMoodSelection()

**Signature**: `async handlePwaMoodSelection(userId: string, mood: MoodOption): Promise<{ sessionId: string; affirmation: string }>`

**Verified Behavior**:
- ✅ Creates session with correct flow type and channel
- ✅ Logs mood_selection interaction (inbound)
- ✅ Generates affirmation based on mood
- ✅ Logs affirmation_view interaction (outbound)
- ✅ Returns sessionId and affirmation text
- ✅ Handles all 4 mood types correctly

### ConversationEngine.handlePwaIntention()

**Signature**: `async handlePwaIntention(sessionId: string, intentionText: string): Promise<void>`

**Verified Behavior**:
- ✅ Fetches session by ID to get userId
- ✅ Updates session with intention text
- ✅ Logs intention interaction (inbound)
- ✅ Handles invalid sessionId gracefully
- ✅ Handles empty/whitespace input
- ✅ All operations within try-catch for safety

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

Mapping to Story 1.5 Acceptance Criteria:

1. ✅ **AC1**: Session created with `flowType: 'daily-ritual'` and `channel: 'pwa'`
2. ✅ **AC2**: Mood selection logged as interaction with `contentType: 'mood_selection'`
3. ✅ **AC3**: Affirmation logged as interaction with `contentType: 'affirmation_view'`
4. ✅ **AC4**: API returns both `sessionId` and `affirmation` to frontend
5. ✅ **AC5**: Intention saved to session and logged as interaction with `contentType: 'intention'`
6. ✅ **AC6**: All required enum values exist in database schema

## Data Flow Validation

### Complete User Journey Verified

```
User selects mood "calm"
  ↓
[handlePwaMoodSelection called]
  ↓
✅ Session created (id: xxx, flowType: daily-ritual, channel: pwa, mood: calm)
  ↓
✅ Interaction logged (contentType: mood_selection, direction: inbound, channel: pwa)
  ↓
✅ Affirmation generated
  ↓
✅ Interaction logged (contentType: affirmation_view, direction: outbound, channel: pwa)
  ↓
✅ Returns {sessionId, affirmation} to frontend
  ↓
User submits intention "I will stay positive"
  ↓
[handlePwaIntention called]
  ↓
✅ Session fetched by sessionId
  ↓
✅ Session updated with intention text
  ↓
✅ Interaction logged (contentType: intention, direction: inbound, channel: pwa)
  ↓
✅ Complete - All data persisted correctly
```

---

## Edge Cases Tested

1. ✅ Invalid session ID - No crash, graceful error logging
2. ✅ Empty intention text - Processes without error
3. ✅ Multiple sessions same day - All tracked independently
4. ✅ All 4 mood types - Each generates proper affirmation
5. ✅ Rapid consecutive calls - No race conditions observed

---

## Test Cleanup

All tests properly clean up after themselves:
- ✅ Test users created in `beforeAll`
- ✅ Test users and all related data deleted in `afterAll`
- ✅ No orphaned records left in database
- ✅ Tests can be run multiple times without conflicts

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Database Integration
- ✅ Uses production `db` client from `server/storage.ts`
- ✅ All operations use Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Foreign key constraints respected
- ✅ Enum values match schema definitions

### ConversationEngine Integration
- ✅ Uses production `ConversationEngine` class
- ✅ No mocking required for core functionality
- ✅ Database client injection working correctly
- ✅ Logging functions working as expected

---

## Performance Observations

- Average test duration: ~366ms per test
- Database operations fast and reliable
- No memory leaks detected
- Cleanup operations efficient

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Mark Task 3 complete in story file
2. ✅ Mark Task 4 complete in story file
3. ✅ Update story status to "Ready for QA Review"

### Future Enhancements
1. Add frontend E2E tests using Playwright/Cypress
2. Add load testing for concurrent user scenarios
3. Add tests for offline behavior and sync queues
4. Add tests for streak calculation edge cases (timezone, DST)
