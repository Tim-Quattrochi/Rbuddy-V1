### **1\. Problem Statement**

Justice-impacted individuals in early reentry with a history of substance use often face overwhelming triggers, unstable routines, and limited support systems. Existing recovery apps are too complex, data-heavy, or lack the empathetic approach needed for this vulnerable population.

Core challenge: How might we deliver structure, encouragement, and relapse resilience through an accessible, empathetic digital companion?

---

### **2\. Target Users**

* **Primary**: Formerly incarcerated individuals in early reentry (first 6‚Äì12 months), especially those in recovery programs or probation supervision
* **Secondary**: Probation officers, case managers, and reentry coaches who support habit accountability
* **Accessibility considerations**:
  * Smartphone access via Lifeline program (free smartphones for qualified users)
  * Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline-first functionality
  * Simple, trauma-informed interface design
  * 6th-grade reading level content

---

### **3\. MVP Goal**

Deliver a low-friction "Daily Ritual Flow" through a Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps users build emotional regulation, accountability, and recovery momentum. The app works offline-first and provides a compassionate, mobile-optimized experience accessible from any smartphone.

---

### **4\. Core MVP Features (PWA Architecture)**

---

## **3\. Solution Vision**

* Provide Daily Ritual check-ins (2‚Äì5 min) via PWA with touch-optimized interface
* Offer mood-based affirmations and grounding tips with calming animations
* When relapse occurs, offer a "Repair" flow‚Äîencouragement, reset planning, and reflection, not shame
* Enable offline functionality so users can check in anytime, anywhere
* Integrate multi-provider AI chat for additional support and reflection
* Design for low friction, high empathy, and human warmth through technology

## **üß≠ Section 1 ‚Äî Vision**

### **Product Vision Statement**

Next Moment is a compassionate, low-barrier digital companion that helps justice-impacted individuals in recovery rebuild daily structure and emotional regulation through simple, accessible SMS or voice (IVR) interactions.

It aims to deliver consistency, connection, and encouragement in moments where traditional digital support systems fail due to low access, literacy, or trust.

Our ‚Äúwhy‚Äù:

* Recovery and reentry are fragile, especially in the first 6‚Äì12 months.  
* Digital inequity isolates the most vulnerable.  
* Next Moment restores human-centered connection via the simplest available technology ‚Äî a basic phone.

North Star Metric: Sustained daily ritual engagement rate (completion ‚â• 60% over 14 days).

---

### **Product Goals**

1. Accessibility: Work for all phones (feature or smart) ‚Äî no data required.  
2. Consistency: Encourage short, daily check-ins that reinforce emotional grounding.  
3. Empathy: Replace judgment with supportive, affirming communication.  
4. Resilience: Reframe relapse as repair, not failure.  
5. Scalability: Build a conversation engine architecture that can later extend to app, web, or AI-assisted coaching.

---

### **Key Differentiators**

| Aspect | Next Moment | Typical Recovery Apps |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Access | SMS & IVR ‚Äî any phone | Smartphone & data required |
| Tone | Peer-like, affirming | Often clinical or punitive |
| Complexity | 2‚Äì5 min ritual | Multi-step app navigation |
| Privacy | Anonymous, opt-in | Accounts \+ personal data |
| Design Principle | ‚ÄúRepair, not failure‚Äù | ‚ÄúReset after relapse‚Äù |

---

### **Vision Summary**

Next Moment transforms everyday mobile communication (text or call) into a ritual of self-care and reflection, offering individuals in reentry a small, consistent success moment each day.  
It stands as a bridge between behavioral recovery, reentry support, and accessible digital health ‚Äî lightweight yet deeply human.

---

## **üì¶ Section 2 ‚Äî Product Scope and Key Use Cases**

---

### **üîπ Actor Clarification: *Returning Citizen with Basic Phone***

Profile Summary:  
An individual recently released from incarceration (typically within the past 6‚Äì12 months), actively engaged in or seeking recovery from substance use disorder.

Context:

* May be enrolled in a reentry or diversion program.  
* Often balancing multiple stressors: housing, employment, probation check-ins, and relapse prevention.  
* May have limited social support and high exposure to triggers.  
* Uses a basic mobile phone (flip or feature) ‚Äî limited data plan, shared device, or prepaid service.

Behavioral Focus:  
The system supports habit formation, emotional regulation, and relapse resilience through short, structured check-ins.  
While not a clinical treatment tool, Next Moment acts as a behavioral reinforcement and recovery companion.


---

## **üß© Name Assessment: ‚ÄúNext Moment‚Äù**

### **1\. Linguistic and Emotional Tone Analysis**

* ‚ÄúReentry‚Äù ‚Üí Clear, functional term used in justice and social service contexts. Recognizable to probation, parole, and reentry professionals.  
* ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù ‚Üí Conveys warmth, friendliness, and approachability. It humanizes the digital tool and lowers the psychological barrier to engagement.

However:

* ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù can also sound overly casual or juvenile when associated with serious recovery journeys or formal programs.  
* Some professional stakeholders (e.g., county reentry coordinators, funders, clinical partners) may perceive it as too informal or non-clinical, especially in grant or compliance documentation.  
* Among peer users, it may actually increase adoption likelihood ‚Äî ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù signals a nonjudgmental, approachable ally rather than a formal authority.

Summary: The name strikes a tone of *friendliness and accessibility* but risks sounding *less serious* in institutional settings.

---

### **2\. Audience Alignment**

| Audience | Likely Reaction | Fit |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Returning citizens (users) | Feels friendly, easy to say, low intimidation. | ‚úÖ Good |
| Recovery coaches / peers | Likely receptive; matches motivational culture. | ‚úÖ Good |
| Probation / reentry officials | May perceive as too informal for documentation or policy integration. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| Funding & partner orgs | Might prefer something that implies structure and legitimacy. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |

---

### **3\. Comparative Tone Benchmarks**

| Name | Tone | Perception |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Next Moment | Friendly, casual | Trustworthy but non-institutional |
| Reentry Coach | Professional, empowering | Formal but approachable |
| Reentry Guide | Supportive, neutral | Professional yet simple |
| Recovery Path | Reflective, hopeful | Emotionally balanced |
| Grounded | Modern, mindful | Youth-friendly, abstract |
| The Reset Line | Conversational, action-oriented | Culturally resonant for relapse recovery |
| Second Step | Hopeful, reentry-aligned | Symbolic, meaningful |

---

### **4\. Recommendation**

Primary Recommendation:  
‚úÖ *Retain ‚ÄúNext Moment‚Äù for the MVP and early-stage pilot,* given:

* Its plain-language accessibility (6th-grade level).  
* Emotional safety for justice-impacted participants.  
* Lower cognitive and stigma barriers.

However, prepare an alternate ‚Äúprofessional name‚Äù for institutional communication and partner adoption.  
A dual-branding model can balance tone across contexts:

| Use Context | Recommended Label |
| ----- | ----- |
| User-facing (SMS/IVR) | ‚ÄúNext Moment‚Äù |
| Institutional / PRD / Grant documents | ‚ÄúReentry Companion‚Äù or ‚ÄúReentry Coach‚Äù |

---

### **5\. Suggested Alternatives (if renaming fully)**

| Option | Tone | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Reentry Coach | Supportive, authoritative | Best all-around professional alternative |
| Reentry Companion | Neutral, empathetic | Friendly yet formal |
| Recovery Line | Simple, accessible | Good for voice/SMS format |
| Reset Support | Plain, action-focused | Emphasizes ‚Äúrepair not failure‚Äù theme |

---

### **6\. Final Recommendation Summary**

* Retain ‚ÄúNext Moment‚Äù for pilot MVP to preserve trust and approachability.  
* Evaluate name perception with participants during early testing.  
* If feedback skews toward ‚Äútoo casual,‚Äù transition to ‚ÄúReentry Coach‚Äù or ‚ÄúReentry Companion‚Äù for broader rollout.  
* Maintain 6th-grade readability and non-stigmatizing language in all brand materials regardless of final name.

---

**üìú Branding Decision Memo (for Integration Reference)**

Decision Context:  
Project name *‚ÄúNext Moment‚Äù* tested positively for accessibility and emotional warmth but may sound overly casual in institutional settings. To balance tone, we adopt a dual-brand strategy for clarity and professionalism.

| Context | Name Used | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| User-facing (SMS/IVR, website, materials) | Next Moment | Plain, friendly, relatable; encourages engagement among returning citizens. |
| Institutional / Partner / PRD Documentation | Reentry Companion | Professional tone for funders, agencies, and partner communications. |

Action:  
PRD will reference the project as ‚ÄúNext Moment (Institutional alias: Reentry Companion)‚Äù throughout.  
Tone in all content will remain trauma-informed, nonjudgmental, and written at a 6th-grade reading level.

### **4.4 Core APIs and Flows**

#### **A. SMS Flow (Twilio Messaging API)**

Inbound:

* Endpoint `/sms/inbound` receives user message.  
* Conversation Engine parses message (e.g., ‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚ÄúSLIP‚Äù, ‚ÄúY‚Äù, free text).

Outbound:

* Endpoint `/sms/outbound` triggered by state machine decisions.  
* Sends preformatted responses via Twilio API.

Sample Payload (Outbound):

`{ "to": "+15551234567", "from": "+18445556789", "body": "Thanks for checking in. Remember, small steps make change." }`  
---

#### **B. IVR Flow (Twilio Voice API)**

Inbound:

* User calls toll-free number ‚Üí Twilio webhook hits `/voice/inbound`.  
* Plays pre-recorded greeting \+ prompts via TwiML response.

Example TwiML:

`<Response> <Say voice="alice">Hi, this is Next Moment. How‚Äôs your mood today?</Say> <Gather input="dtmf" numDigits="1" action="/voice/mood-response"/> </Response>`

Follow-up:

* User presses key ‚Üí engine fetches response from content bank.  
* Logs DTMF response, triggers affirmation playback.

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `start` | Daily reminder / user initiation | `mood_prompt` | Send mood question |
| `mood_prompt` | User input (1‚Äì4) | `response` | Fetch and send affirmation |
| `response` | User input Y/N for intention | `intention` or `end` | Capture intention if Y |
| `intention` | Free-text or voice input | `end` | Log data |
| `repair_start` | Keyword ‚ÄúSLIP‚Äù | `trigger_type` | Acknowledge \+ prompt for trigger |
| `trigger_type` | User input (1‚Äì4) | `repair_tip` | Send reset advice |
| `repair_tip` | Message sent | `follow_up` (24h) | Schedule next-day encouragement |
