## ðŸš¨ Critical Checklist - Route Path Verification

**IMPORTANT**: If this PR modifies routes, answer these questions:

- [ ] Does this PR add or modify any user-related routes?
- [ ] If yes, verified all routes use `/api/users/...` (PLURAL, not `/api/user/...`)?
- [ ] Ran `grep -n "/api/user/" server/routes.ts` and confirmed NO matches?
- [ ] Verified frontend calls match route paths exactly?
- [ ] Tested the endpoints manually (not just unit tests)?

**Files to verify if routes changed:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Route registration
- `api/users/[action].ts` - Handler implementation  
- Client code calling the endpoints

## Additional Checks
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No console.log() or debugging code left in
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run check`)
