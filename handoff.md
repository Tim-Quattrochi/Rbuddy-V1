- Phase 2 (Database Schema Migration) - 100% complete ✅
- Phase 3 (Backend API) - 100% complete ✅
Current Phase: Phase 4 (PWA Frontend Development) - 0% complete
Git Status
Branch: main
Last Commit: 3d22607 - "feat: pivot from Twilio SMS to PWA architecture"

   - IntentionInput.tsx (optional text input)
   - DailyRitual.tsx (main flow orchestrator)
   - RepairFlow.tsx (slip recovery flow)
   - Dashboard.tsx (streak counter, mood trends)
   - Login.tsx (phone verification UI)
4. Connect components to REST API endpoints
5. Implement service worker with Workbox

🧠 Context: How We Got Here
User's Original Problem
Twilio phone number approval is costly and complex
Considering gutting Twilio for web-based PWA

Elicitation Process Used
BMad Task: /advanced-elicitation
Method Selected: Red Team vs Blue Team (option 2)
Blue Team defended SMS/IVR approach
Red Team advocated for PWA pivot
User validated smartphone accessibility via Lifeline program

User's Decision
"b. pivot to PWA. I agree that smart phones are given for free with lifeline"

🎯 Phase 4 Objectives (Next Agent's Task)
Must Complete (Days 5-7 - Oct 15-17):
[ ] Create PWA manifest.json and generate icons
[ ] Configure vite-plugin-pwa in vite.config.ts
[ ] Build React components for Daily Ritual flow
[ ] Build React components for Repair flow
[ ] Implement authentication UI (Login.tsx)
[ ] Connect all components to REST API endpoints
[ ] Add routing with React Router
[ ] Implement service worker caching strategies
[ ] Test PWA installation flow

Success Criteria:
✅ PWA manifest.json served correctly
✅ App installable on both iOS and Android
✅ Service worker registered and caching app shell
✅ All Daily Ritual flow steps work end-to-end
✅ Repair flow triggers compassionate messages
✅ Authentication flow (phone verification) functional
✅ API integration working (mood selection → affirmation → intention)
✅ Responsive design (mobile-first)
📚 Essential Documentation
Read First:
docs/pwa-pivot-progress.md - Complete tracking doc (Phases 1-3 complete)
docs/prd.md - Updated PRD (Section 4.3 has API endpoint specs)
server/routes.ts - All 11 REST API endpoints (ready for frontend integration)
server/storage.ts - Extended storage layer with PWA methods

Reference Materials:
PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Original project brief
shared/schema.ts - Database schema (fully migrated for PWA)
server/services/conversationEngine.ts - FSM that returns JSON
client/src/components/ - Existing UI components (shadcn/ui library)
🚨 Important Notes
Database Migration Decision
DO: Select "rename" option in drizzle-kit
DON'T: Create new interactions table (would lose existing SMS data)
Why: Existing messages contain valuable conversation history
Backwards Compatibility
Schema includes: export const messages = interactions;
This allows existing imports to work during transition
Can be removed in Phase 3 after refactoring complete
Cost Tracking
Before PWA: $91/month (Twilio $15 + SMS $75.84)
After PWA: $39/month (Vercel Pro $20 + Neon $19)
Savings: $624/year
User's Dev Preferences (from .claude/CLAUDE.md)
Use descriptive branch names: feat/implement-pwa-frontend
Logical commits after testing each feature
No '🤖 Generated with Claude Code' in PRs/commits (user explicitly requested removal)
Avoid overly verbose comments
Check off task lists as you go
Never delete handoff.md files (consolidate instead)

 Manual E2E tests passing

🚀 Final Note
Backend infrastructure is 100% complete and tested. Frontend development can begin immediately. The pivot was well-reasoned through Red Team vs Blue Team elicitation, validated by user confirmation of smartphone accessibility via Lifeline program. Key insight: Leveraging existing infrastructure while reducing costs ($624/year savings) and improving UX.

**On Track**: 3/6 phases complete, 7 days remaining to MVP delivery (Oct 20, 2025).
